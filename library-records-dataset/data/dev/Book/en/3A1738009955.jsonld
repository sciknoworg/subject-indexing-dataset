            "abstract": [
                "Atmospheric reactive nitrogen (N) emissions, as an important component of global N cycle, have been significantly altered by anthropogenic activities, and consequently have had a global impact on air pollution and ecosystem services. Due to rapid agricultural, industrial, and urban development, China has been experiencing an increase in reactive N emissions and deposition since the late 1970s. Based on a literature review, this book summarizes recent research on: 1) atmospheric reactive N in China from a global perspective (Chapter 1); 2) atmospheric reactive N emissions, deposition and budget in China (Chapters 2-5); 3) the contribution of atmospheric reactive N to air pollution (e.g., haze, surface O3, and acid deposition) (Chapters 6-8); 4) the impacts of N deposition on sensitive ecosystems (e.g., forests, grasslands, deserts and lakes) (Chapters 9-12); and 5) the regulatory strategies for mitigation of atmospheric reactive N pollution from agricultural and non-agricultural sectors in China (Chapters 13-14). As such it offers graduate students, researchers, educators in agricultural, ecological and environmental sciences, and policy makers a glimpse of the environmental issues related to reactive N in China",

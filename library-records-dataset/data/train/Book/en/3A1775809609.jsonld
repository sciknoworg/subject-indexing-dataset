            "title": "Design principles for embedded systems",
            "abstract": "The book is designed to serve as a textbook for courses offered to graduate and undergraduate students enrolled in electronics and electrical engineering and computer science. This book attempts to bridge the gap between electronics and computer science students, providing complementary knowledge that is essential for designing an embedded system. The book covers key concepts tailored for embedded system design in one place. The topics covered in this book are models and architectures, Executable Specific Languages \u2013 SystemC, Unified Modeling Language, real-time systems, real-time operating systems, networked embedded systems, Embedded Processor architectures, and platforms that are secured and energy-efficient. A major segment of embedded systems needs hard real-time requirements. This textbook includes real-time concepts including algorithms and real-time operating system standards like POSIX threads. Embedded systems are mostly distributed and networked for deterministic responses. The book covers how to design networked embedded systems with appropriate protocols for real-time requirements. Each chapter contains 2-3 solved case studies and 10 real-world problems as exercises to provide detailed coverage and essential pedagogical tools that make this an ideal textbook for students enrolled in electrical and electronics engineering and computer science programs.",

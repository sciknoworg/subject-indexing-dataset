It will help professionals develop and follow an effective risk culture. In addition, it shows how compliance with well-recognized and mandated standards are important for every organization as well as shows how a corporation can demonstrate that it is following best practices and is in conformity with regulatory rules. New topics to be discussed include: (a) the PCAOB's (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's) release of AS5, which calls for enterprises to perform \"top down\" risk analyses of their own internal controls, as a major step to SOx compliance; (b) ISACA's (Information Systems Audit and Control Association) recently revised CobiT (Control Objectives for Information related Technology) with a major emphasis on understanding risk when evaluating and assessing IT and enterprise internal controls. This book will discuss the importance of understanding risks when using CobiT; (c) the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) Standards recently released specify that internal auditors must assess risks when performing their internal audits; (d) ISO 3100, a standard on risk management, will be introduced; and (e) the AICPA's recently released Risk Assessment Standards for private companies\"--",

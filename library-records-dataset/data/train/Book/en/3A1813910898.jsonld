The book also covers the utilization of marine surfactants for biological and biomedical, and environmental applications. Marine Surfactants: Preparations and Applications, aims to examine every aspect of marine derived surfactants.The first part of the book discusses the isolation of marine surfactants from various organisms include marine bacteria, algae, cyanobacteria and etc. The editors also examine the cultivation of marine microorganisms and the harvesting of other natural biological resources from the sea. The next part of the book discusses the application element of the marine surfactants including oil spill removal in the sea, bioremediation of polluted water and soil, treatment for breast cancer, restoration of marine environments, nanoparticles synthesis, and development of different kinds of emulsifiers. With contributions from world renowned experts in the field, this book will be an essential resource in understanding and developing various marine-derived surfactants. This book is intended for researchers, marine biotechnologists as well as medical practitioners working on a vast range of industrial and medical applications using marine materials. It would also be useful for students looking to understand the utilization of marine derived surfactants\"--",

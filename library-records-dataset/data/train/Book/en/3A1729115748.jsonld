            "abstract": "This book provides a comprehensive review of recent innovations in food science that are being used to tackle the challenges of food safety, nutritional security and sustainability. With a major focus on developing nations, like India, the book is divided into four main sections. The first section provides an overview of the food industry, while the second explores food safety in various segments, with an interesting account of street food safety \u2013 an important, yet often neglected aspect for safety parameters. The third section, on nutritional security and sustainability, explores various ways of maximizing nutrition and optimizing waste management in the food industry. The book closes with a section on emerging technologies and innovations, which introduces readers to some of the latest technologies in the food industry, including advances in food processing, packaging, nanotechnology, etc. The topics have been divided into 25 different chapters, which offer a diverse blend of perspectives on innovations in the developing world. Ideally suited for students and researchers in the food sciences, the book is also an interesting read for industry experts in Food Science and Technology.",

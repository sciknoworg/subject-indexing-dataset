                "\"Invitation to Peace Studies is the first textbook in the field to emphasize 21st-century topics and the latest empirical research, as well as the first to prominently apply a gender perspective to the topics of peace, war, and violence. The book covers traditional peace studies' concerns with interstate wars while offering an equal emphasis on intrastate wars, group- and gender-based violence, and on the many nonviolent movements which have shaped recent world history. Clear and accessible language invites students to become more frequent and effective peace promoters in their own everyday lives. Dozens of case studies and textboxes foreground contemporary topics such as climate change, cyber warfare, digital activism, drones and robots, the occupy movement, peace ecology, positive psychology, religion and violence, and terrorism\"--",
                "\"Invitation to Peace Studies is the first textbook in the field to emphasize 21st-century research and controversies and to encourage the more frequent use of a gender perspective in analyzing peace, war and violence. Recent empirical research forms the core of most chapters, but substantial attention is also given to faith-based ideas, movements, and peace pioneers. The book examines compelling contemporary topics like cyber warfare, drones, robots, digital activism, hactivism, the physiology of peace, rising rates of suicide, and peace through health. It is also unique in its use of a single coherent perspective--that of a global peace network--to make sense of the historically unprecedented and interconnected web of diverse ideas, individuals, groups, organizations, and movements currently promoting peace across the world\"--"

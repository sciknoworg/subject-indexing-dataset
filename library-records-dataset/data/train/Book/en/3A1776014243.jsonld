            "abstract": "\"In the almost twenty years since I began writing my essays on strange and quirky optics I have been through several employers, but in all that time I have stayed a contributing editor for the Optical Society of America. No matter where I was during the day, I always worked on producing these nuggets of infotainment with some regularity. I have always had a backlog of tentative pieces to write, but new topics arose just as rapidly, so I have never been at a loss with a new piece. The newsletter of MIT's Spectroscopy Lab has, in that time, disappeared, so the essays in this volume are either ones that originally appeared in Optics and Photonics News, or else have not previously been published in any magazine. As I stated in the introduction to How the Ray Gun Got Its Zap!, my goal was to produce quirky, interesting, and somewhat humorous essays that had a slyly pedagogical edge. \"Education by stealth,\" as the BBC said. In reality, I often start off writing one of these to satisfy myself about some minor mystery of optical science or engineering\"--",

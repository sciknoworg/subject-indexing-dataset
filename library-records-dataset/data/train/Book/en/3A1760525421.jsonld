            "abstract": "\"This book addresses the problem of waste management by using multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. The authors discuss how to apply MCDM, a complex decision-making tool that involves both quantitative and qualitative factors, to develop strategies for effective waste management. The book explains how to apply MCDM techniques that utilize various optimization models to rank alternatives, while also incorporating the concerns and needs of multiple stakeholders to find the most optimal decisions for various types of wastes. Typically, there does not exist a singular optimal solution to waste problems; with help of MCDM, far better solutions can often be found and utilized to facilitate sustainable waste management techniques in various industries. Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Techniques in Waste Management: A Case Study of India discusses the application of fuzzy COPRAS-based multi-criteria decision-making strategies to address the ever-growing need to manage waste. The authors also address the application of MCDM for different types of wastes and waste products, such as biomedical wastes. They also consider innovative e-waste management strategies, showing how the use of highly sensitive Internet of Thing-based devices along with artificial intelligence (AI) can make significant positive changes in waste recycling. Case studies are included to help illustrate the text. This book provides unique, effective, and quick decision-making strategies for waste management. With the ever-increasing population and continuing human development, the problem of managing waste becomes increasingly essential, and this volume helps lead the way to finding sustainable solutions\"--",

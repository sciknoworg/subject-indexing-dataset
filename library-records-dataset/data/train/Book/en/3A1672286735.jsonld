            "abstract": "\"This new book, Drinking Water Safety: Basic Principles and Applications, examines the technical and scientific, as well as regulatory, ethical, and emerging issues of pollution prevention, sustainability and optimization for the production and management of safe drinking water in order to cope with environmental pollution, population growth, increasing demand, terrorist threats, and climate change pressures. It presents a summary of conventional water and wastewater treatment technologies, in addition to the latest water treatment technologies and processes, including separate chapters on evaporation, crystallization, nanotechnology, membrane-based processes, and innovative desalination approaches. It also offers numerous illustrative examples and case studies, as well as an appendix with sections on units and conversion constants. In addition: Provides a summary of the current status and future of water resources and water availability in the U.S. and globally. Summarizes key U.S. regulatory programs designed to ensure protection of water quality, and safe drinking water supplies, with details on modern approaches for water utility resilience and planning for natural and intentional human-caused system upsets and recovery. Examines the latest water treatment technologies and processes, including separate chapters on evaporation, crystallization, nanotechnology, membrane-based processes, and innovative desalination approaches. Reviews and provides an introduction to the specialized literature on pollution prevention, sustainability, and the role of optimization in water treatment and related areas, as well as references for further reading. Provides illustrative examples and case studies that complement the text throughout\"--",

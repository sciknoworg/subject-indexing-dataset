The text provides a comprehensive treatment of the field on subjects ranging from fundamental theoretical principles and new technological developments to state-of-the-art device design, as well as examples encompassing a wide range of related sub-areas. The content of the book covers all-dielectric and metallodielectric optical metasurface deep learning-accelerated inverse-design, deep neural networks for inverse scattering, applications of deep learning for advanced antenna design, and other related topics.To aid in reader comprehension, each chapter contains 10-15 illustrations, including prototype photos, line graphs, and electric field plots. Contributed to by leading research groups in the field, sample topics covered in Advances in Electromagnetics Empowered by Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning include:_ Optical and photonic design, including generative machine learning for photonic design and inverse design of electromagnetic systems_ RF and antenna design, including artificial neural networks for parametric electromagnetic modeling and optimization and analysis of uniform and non-uniform antenna arrays_ Inverse scattering, target classification, and other applications, including deep learning for high contrast inverse scattering of electrically large structuresAdvances in Electromagnetics Empowered by Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning is a must-have resource on the topic for university faculty, graduate students, and engineers within the fields of electromagnetics, wireless communications, antenna/RF design, and photonics, as well as researchers at large defense contractors and government laboratories",

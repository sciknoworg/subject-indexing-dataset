                "\"This volume contributed another high-quality edition to the series of Proceedings, in that it reports a wide range of disciplines that contribute to astronautics. Of particular merit in this issue are chapters that report the politics and context of initiatives undertaken in the early years of the U.S. space program and the background behind the difficult birth of the British National Space Centre. The 2008 International Astronautical Congress, held in Glasgow, Scotland, came at a key time, in that it undoubtedly assisted in the reawakening and broadening of support by the British government to the wider UK space industry. One session was dedicated to the past heritage of the United Kingdom in space and astronautics, and how this has evolved into the current position. It is one objective of the International Astronautical Federation in bringing congresses to particular countries, that it energizes the host country to look seriously at the level of support given to space. By including such dedicated sessions with the specific focus on the history of the host country's space-related activities and initiatives, the International Academy of Astronautics significantly contributes to this objective. It has been a privilege to have been part of the process that contributed to the reported histories of mankind's attempts to reach for the stars.\" --"

                "Advanced Methods of Pharmacokinetic and Pharmocodynamic Systems Analysis Volume 3 is vital to professionals and academicians working in drug development and bioengineering. Both basic and clinical scientists will benefit from this work. This book contains chapters by leading researchers in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling and will be of interest to anyone involved with the application of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics to drug development. The use of mathematical modeling and associated computational methods is central to the study of the absorption, distribution and elimination of therapeutic drugs (pharmacokinetics) and to understanding how drugs produce their effects (pharmacodynamics). From its inception, the field of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics has incorporated methods of mathematical modeling, simulation and computation in an effort to better understand and quantify the processes of uptake, disposition and action of therapeutic drugs. These methods for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic systems analysis impact all aspects of drug development. In vitro, animal and human testing, as well as drug therapy are all influenced by these methods. Modeling methodologies developed for studying pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic processes confront many challenges. This is related in part to the severe restrictions on the number and type of measurements that are available from laboratory experiments and clinical trials, as well as the variability in the experiments and the uncertainty associated with the processes themselves. The contributions are organized in three main areas: Mechanism-Based PK/PD, Pharmacometrics and Pharmacotherapy. Both professionals and academics will profit from this extensive work."

                "The 10th International Workshop on Intelligent Statistical Quality Control took place in Seattle, USA, Aug 18-20, 2010. It was hosted by Professor C. M. Mastrangelo, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle. The workshop was jointly organized by Professors H.- J. Lenz, C. M. Mastrangelo, W. Schmid and P.-T. Wilrich. The twenty-seven papers in this volume were carefully selected by the scientific program committee, reviewed by its members, revised by the authors and, finally, adapted for this volume by the editors. The book is divided into two parts: Part I \"On-line Control\" covers fields like control charting, monitoring and surveillance as well as acceptance sampling. Part II \"Off-line Control\" is devoted to experimental design, process capability analysis and data quality. The purpose of the book is on the one hand to provide insights into important new developments in the area of statistical quality control \u2013 especially surveillance and monitoring \u2013 and on the other hand to critically discuss methods used in on-line and off-line statistical quality control.",

                "th The 24 Computer Graphics International Conference (CGI 2006) was held during June 26\u201328, 2006, in Hangzhou, China. This volume contains 39 full papers and 39 short papers accepted by CGI 2006. CGI conference was initially founded by the Computer Graphics Society in 1983 and has now become a widely recognized, high-quality academic conference in the field of computer graphics. Recent CGI conferences were held in New York (2005), Crete (2004), Tokyo (2003), Bradford (2002), Hong Kong (2001) and Geneva (2000). The CGI 2006 Program Committee received an overwhelming 387 submissions from many countries worldwide. China and Korea contributed many enthusiastic submissions. Based on the strict review comments of international experts, we selected 38 full papers and 37 short papers for presentations. The main topics covered by the papers in this volume include: \u2022 Digital geometry processing and meshes \u2022 Physically based animation \u2022 Figure modeling and animation \u2022 Geometric computing and processing \u2022 Non-photorealistic rendering \u2022 Image-based techniques \u2022 Visualization We are grateful to all the authors who submitted their papers to CGI 2006, to the international Program Committee members and external reviewers for their valuable time and effort spent in the review process, and members of the Organizing Committee for their hard work which made this conference successful. Finally, we would like to thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China and K. C. Wong Education Foundation, Hong Kong, for their financial support.",

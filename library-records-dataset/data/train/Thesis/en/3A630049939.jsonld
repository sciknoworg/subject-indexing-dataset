            "title": "Investigation of large scale structures in the solar chromosphere with the full-disk telescope ChroTel",
            "abstract": "The corona surrounding our Sun exhibits a temperature of a million degrees and higher, which is significantly higher than the surface temperature of about 6000 K. Still, it is one of the pivotal tasks in solar physics to find and understand the governing processes that are heating the corona. The chromosphere thereby plays a major role as it is the intermediate layer between the photosphere representing the solar surface and the hot outer atmosphere. In the present work, large scale structures in the chromosphere are being investigated, for example the chromospheric network and regions beneath coronal holes. This was done using data from the new Chromospheric Telescope ChroTel of the Kiepenheuer-Institute, which is being introduced in the course of this work. Along the way, an automated data handling was developed which allows public access to the data already minutes after recording. The investigation of the dynamics of the large scale structures is based on full-disk Doppler maps in the spectral line of He I 10830 A originating in the upper chromosphere. These were derived by reconstructing line shifts from intensities in filtergrams centered at different wavelengths. For the reconstruction, the true line shifts were needed as a reference, which were known from simultaneous scans with a spectrograph in several small regions on the solar surface. The reconstruction was optimized by applying different weightings to the filtergrams until a minimum was found for the difference of the true and the reconstructed velocities in these regions...",

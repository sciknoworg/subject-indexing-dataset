# üìë Subject Classification Dataset of Library Records

## üîç About

The XYZ library‚Äîone of the national libraries in Germany‚Äîindexes its technical records using the GND subjects taxonomy. Initially, a set of core GND subject classes was defined to guide this process, but as the technical sciences evolved, the library‚Äôs records have grown to include subjects beyond these original core areas.

## üìÇ Repositories Included

- [**data**](./data): Contains the library records in jsonld format in precreated train/dev/test splits for experimental purposes. The `train dataset` contains 90,452 records, `dev dataset` contains 19,949 records and the `test dataset` contains 27,998 records. 

Each record contains various metadata items. The important ones are the following. 1) For the tag `subject` with a list of values, just the strings with prefix "(classificationName=linsearch:mapping).." This is relevant for the domain classification task. 28 total domains are considered within this library system. Also note that a record can have multiple domains annotated. Therefore this is a multi-class classification task. Note 314 records lack domain annotations. The list of these records can be found [here](./data-statistics/Records_without_Domains.json) and must be excluded from training. 2) Tag `dcterms:subject` which is a list of GND IDs that defines the objective of the subject indexing task. And, 3) tags `title` and `abstract` for obviuous reasons being the data points as input to the classification algorithm.

Note that this dataset is obtained from an actual public library. This has implications for its quality and is reflective of the real-world in the sense that it has been created longitudinally over the lifetime of this library. This also means that over time there have been changes in subject matter expert library staff etc. Nevertheless, it presents a valuable resource to the community to build reliable AI tools for librarians, where the design of the AI tools is formulated based on the overall pattern of the data and additional reasoning, rather than being thrown off course by particularities. 

- [**data-statistics**](./data-statistics/): Various stats insights into the domain and subject annotations of the library records dataset.


## üßê A Guide to Reading the Library Records

Each TIBKAT technical record in the repositories is provided in `json-ld` format. You can view an example English record [here](https://github.com/sciknoworg/llms4subjects/blob/main/shared-task-datasets/TIBKAT/all-subjects/data/train/Article/en/3A1499846525.jsonld) and an example German record [here](https://github.com/sciknoworg/llms4subjects/blob/main/shared-task-datasets/TIBKAT/all-subjects/data/train/Article/de/3A168396733X.jsonld). These files contain various property annotations, with the four most relevant to **LLMs4Subjects** being `title`, `abstract`, `dcterms:subject` and `subject`. Participants are free to use other properties as needed. This guide provides an overview of how to interpret a TIBKAT record, focusing on the `dcterms:subject` and `subject` properties.

### Understanding the Subject Properties

Each TIBKAT technical record contains the properties `subject` and `dcterms:subject`, which describes the domains and topics covered by a given resource. These properties are essential for ensuring that systems perform effectively in both Subtask 1 and Subtask 2.

#### [The TIBKAT Domain Property for Subtask 1 - Multi-domain Classification](#how-to-domains)

The `subject` property includes keywords, phrases, or classification codes that reflect the content. Subject annotations in TIBKAT records are provided by a team of 17 expert subject specialists, covering 28 different subjects, including:

- Architecture, Civil Engineering, Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Energy Technology, Educational Science, Earth Sciences, History, Information Technology, Literary Studies and Linguistics, Mechanical Engineering, Mathematics, Medical Technology, Plant Sciences, Philosophy, Physics, Law, Study of Religions, Social Sciences, Sports Sciences, Theology, Environmental Engineering, Traffic Engineering, Materials Science, and Economics.

For this edition of the shared task and specifically for Subtask 1, only domains related to Fachsystematik LinSearch should be considered. More information about Fachsystematik LinSearch can be found [here](https://terminology.tib.eu/ts/ontologies/linsearch).

#### [The `dcterms:subject` Property for Subtask 2 - Subject Indexing](#how-to-subjects)

The `dcterms:subject` property (often represented as `<dc:subject>` in XML or similar formats) describes the subjects or topics covered by the resource. 

#### How to Read the `dcterms:subject` Property

1. **Access the TIBKAT Record:** Start by accessing the JSON-LD TIBKAT records in the dataset or supplementary dataset folders.

2. **Locate the `dcterms:subject` Property:** Find the `dcterms:subject` property in the record. This property may contain one or more subject headings, each sourced from the GND Sachbegriff (subject headings) taxonomy. More information on GND and its role in TIBKAT can be found in the GND shared task dataset subfolder.

3. **Interpret the Subject Entries:** Each entry under the `dcterms:subject` property represents a subject or topic relevant to the resource. These are typically classification codes from the GND subject headings.

4. **Use the Subjects for Research:** The subject codes listed under the `dcterms:subject` property, when mapped to their corresponding labels, are useful for understanding the focus of the resource, conducting research, or finding related materials in the library catalog.

### Conclusion

Understanding the `dcterms:subject` and `subject` property within TIBKAT records is crucial for researchers, librarians, and anyone working on categorizing or finding resources by subject. By focusing on this property, users can gain insights into the content and relevance of the resources cataloged in the TIBKAT system.

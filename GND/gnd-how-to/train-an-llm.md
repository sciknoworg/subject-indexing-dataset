## Guide to train an LLM on the GND

Finetuning a large language model (LLM) like GPT on a dataset such as the GND (Gemeinsame Normdatei or Integrated Authority File in English) for subject classification involves several steps. These steps include data preprocessing, choosing an appropriate model architecture, finetuning the model, and finally evaluating its performance. Below is a detailed guide on how to approach this task:

### 1. Data Preprocessing

#### Extract Relevant Information

When finetuning an LLM for subject classification with the Gemeinsame Normdatei (GND) records, understanding and utilizing the rich semantic structure of the data is crucial. The GND's comprehensive schema includes a variety of data fields that can enrich the model's learning context beyond just the primary subject headings (150) and general subdivisions (550). Here's an overview of additional field tags that might be instrumental in learning the semantics of a subject term:

##### 150 and 550 (Main Subject Heading and General Subdivision)

    - 150: Main subject heading, which provides the primary topic of the record.
    - 550: Related or additional subject categories or general subdivisions that further specify the context or subtopics.

##### Other Relevant Field Tags

    - 043 (Geographic Area Code): Contains codes that represent geographic areas, useful for understanding the regional focus or origin of a subject.
    - 080 (Universal Decimal Classification Number): Offers a numeric classification that could align with the subject's categorization in a broader classification system.
    - 100 (Main Entry-Personal Name): Indicates the name of a person associated with the subject, useful for identifying works or theories directly tied to individuals.
    - 130 (Main Entry-Uniform Title): This can be particularly useful for identifying standard works or canonical texts associated with a subject.
    - 151 (Geographic Name): Similar to 043 but provides the full name of geographic locations, offering contextual clues about the subject's relevance to specific places.
    - 653 (Index Term-Uncontrolled): Contains uncontrolled index terms that might offer additional insights or contemporary terminology related to the subject.
    - 670 (Source Data Found): Provides references or sources where the subject term is found or discussed, potentially offering insights into the term's application or interpretation in various contexts.
    - 675 (Vocabulary Control): Indicates the controlled vocabularies or classification schemes used, which could help in understanding the subject's positioning within broader or related domains.
    - 678 (Biographical or Historical Data): Offers biographical or historical context that can be essential for understanding the development, significance, or scope of a subject term.

##### Hierarchical Relationship Tags

    - 450 (See Also From Tracing-Subject): References related subject headings that could provide a broader or narrower context.
    - 500 (See Also From Tracing-General): Points to general see-also references, which can help in understanding related concepts or terms.
    - 550 (See Also From Tracing-Subject): As mentioned, it indicates related subject headings but also serves to establish hierarchical relationships between terms, such as broader terms (BT), narrower terms (NT), and related terms (RT).

##### Utilizing Relationships and Contexts

Understanding the relationships between these fields and how they contribute to the semantics of a subject term is key. For example, geographic and biographical fields can add significant context that influences the subject's meaning or relevance. Additionally, the use of controlled and uncontrolled index terms (e.g., 653) along with references to standard classification systems (e.g., 080 UDC numbers) enriches the model's understanding of how subjects relate to broader knowledge domains and contemporary terminology.

Incorporating this information into the training data requires careful preprocessing to structure these elements as informative context for the model. This might involve creating composite prompts that include not only the subject heading but also these additional contextual elements to guide the model in making more informed and nuanced classifications.

#### Convert XML to Structured Format

Convert the XML records into a structured format like JSON or CSV, where each record contains the subject heading, associated terms, and any hierarchical information. This conversion makes it easier to manipulate and feed the data into the model.

### 2. Model Selection

Choose a model architecture that's suitable for text classification tasks. Given the complexity and size of the GND dataset, a transformer-based model like GPT-3 or its variants could be a good starting point due to their high performance in understanding and generating human-like text.

### 3. Data Splitting

Split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets. A common split ratio is 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. This separation allows you to train the model, tune hyperparameters, and evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

### 4. Finetuning the Model

#### Prepare the Input Data

Transform the structured records into a format that's suitable for the model. This often involves creating prompt-response pairs where the prompt includes the input text (e.g., a description or title of a work), and the response is the expected subject heading or classification.

##### Model Training

Use the training set to finetune the model. This process involves adjusting the weights of the pretrained model using the gradient descent optimization algorithm to minimize the difference between the model's predictions and the actual labels.

##### Hyperparameter Tuning

Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, to find the best combination that minimizes your validation loss.

### 5. Evaluation and Iteration

After finetuning, evaluate the model's performance on the test set to see how well it generalizes to unseen data. Common evaluation metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Based on these metrics, you may need to go back and adjust your model's architecture, data preprocessing, or training procedure.

### 6. Post-Training Adjustments

Based on the evaluation, you might need to adjust your approach. This could involve gathering more data, further preprocessing steps, adjusting the model architecture, or continuing the training for more epochs.

### 7. Deployment

Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it in a suitable environment where it can receive input records and output the appropriate GND subject headings.
Additional Considerations

    - Understand the GND Structure: Before starting, it's crucial to have a deep understanding of the GND's structure and how subject headings are organized.
    - Handling Hierarchical Data: The GND's hierarchical nature may require special attention during model training to ensure that the relationships between broader and narrower terms are correctly learned.
    - Resource Requirements: Training and finetuning large language models require significant computational resources. Ensure you have access to adequate hardware or cloud computing services.

This process outlines a general approach to finetuning a large language model on the GND for subject classification. Adjustments and optimizations are often necessary based on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the model's initial performance.

            "abstract": "Milk is a highly perishable commodity; heat treatment or pasteurization can be used to make fresh milk safe to drink, but these methods do not destroy the spoilage organisms. Processing milk into ordinary dairy products extends its shelf-life, reduces wastage and adds value to the milk, creating more income for the producer. In addition, processing converts the lactose in milk into lactic acid, making dairy products to those who suffer from lactose intolerance. This book outlines traditional methods of processing milk to produce cheese, butter, yoghurt and other milk products, and discusses how hygiene and quality control can be improved, essential if the quantities of milk produced are to be increased beyond the household level to give increased income. \"Dairy Processing\" avoids introducing completely new products or processes, but suggests low-cost modifications to traditional methods which can be and have been introduced successfully. Case studies describe the introduction of improved businesses around the world, and there is a list of useful organizations",

            "abstract": "This contributed volume presents new insight into sustainable possibilities of combination of nanomaterial and bioenergy production together. Biofuels as renewable energy sources have tremendous potential to replace fossil fuels in future energy scenario as biofuels production is likely to be advanced and novel research areas offers green alternative energy sources. continuous efforts are being made for the cost-effective production of biofuels worldwide to balance its techno-economy. In series of tremendous effort to improve biofuels production technologies, use of nanomaterials to improve biofuels production efficiency is highly emerging area with full scope to developed low cost, rapid technologies for biofuels production. The book covers the practical utility based properties of nanomaterial and bioenergy production together. It also discusses the recent advancements on various nanomaterial utility in biofuel production process along with its low cost application. It covers mega audiences, which include academician, researchers, and industries people. This book will be highly interesting for researchers and scientists as well as related industries.",

                "Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome draws together the experiences of the leading experts in the field. Through their work in all aspects of congenital cardiac care, they have become acknowledged as the world leaders in the diagnostic, medical and social needs of children born with hypoplasia of the left heart. More importantly, for the first time the book recognizes the crucial contributions made by the families of these children. Diagnostic possibilities, options for medical and surgical treatment and a history of their evolution are looked into and the book also gives an insight into the longer-term effects that treatment has on the child and its family. As well as including contributions from medical clinicians, nurses, and psychologists, for the first time a forum is provided for the parents, who have complemented the contributions from the medical and nursing experts to provide a holistic view of the lives and experiences of the children born with this condition. No other publication, currently available, offers such a comprehensive overview of the care required by a child with hypoplasia of the left heart. This book provides the ultimate reference for anyone treating children with this heart condition, particularly paediatric cardiac clinical and nursing teams, radiologists and radiographers, obstetric medical and nursing teams, psychologists, pathologists, geneticists and workers in social care.",

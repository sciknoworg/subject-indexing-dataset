                "This updated book explores a wide repertoire of tools and approaches that have been created, modified, and applied to the study of L. monocytogenes, forming the basis of our understanding of the bacterium today. Many of these key experimental techniques are gathered together herein. The volume presents aspects such as clinical disease and host-pathogen interactions, as well as the study of biofilms which present a significant challenge for control of the organism in the food processing environment. The topics covered in this edition also include sampling in order to isolate Listeria, methods for their identification and characterization, methods for gene manipulation, and methods for control of the organism. Written for the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Authoritative and up-to-date, Listeria monocytogenes: Methods and Protocols, Second Edition aims to contribute toward the harmonization of methods used to study this important bacterium, and to be of particular interest to Listeria research both in relation to food association and control as well as clinical microbiology."

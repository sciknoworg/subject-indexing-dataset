            "abstract": "\"The technologies applied in design studies vary from basic theories to more application-based systems, and intelligence engineering technologies - such as computer-aided industrial design, human factor design, and greenhouse design - play a significant role in design science. Intelligence engineering technologies encompass both theoretical and application perspectives, such as computational technologies, sensing technologies, and video detection. Intelligence engineering is multidisciplinary in nature, promoting cooperation, exchange and discussion between organizations and researchers from diverse fields. This book presents the proceedings of DSIE2021, the 2021 International Symposium on Design Studies and Intelligence Engineering, held in Hangzhou, China, on 27 & 28 November 2021. This annual conference invites renowned experts from around the world to speak on their specialist topics, providing a platform for many professionals and researchers from industry and academia to exchange and discuss recent advances in the field of design studies and intelligence engineering. The 210 submissions received were rigorously reviewed, and each of the 50 papers presented here was selected based on scores from three or four referees. Papers cover a very wide range of topics, from the design of a pneumatic soft finger with two joints, and the emotion of texture, to the design evaluation of a health management terminal for the elderly, and a multi-robot planning algorithm with quad tree map division for obstacles of irregular shape. Providing a varied overview of recent developments in design and intelligence engineering, this book will be of interest to researchers and all those working in the field\"--",

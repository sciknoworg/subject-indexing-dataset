                "Cell mechanical properties reveal substantial information on cell state and function. Utilizing mechanics as a label-free biomarker allows for investigation of fundamental cellular processes as well as biomedical applications, e.g., disease diagnosis. High-throughput methods for accessing the elastic properties of cells in suspension from hydrodynamic deformation in a microfluidic constriction are available with real-time analysis rates of up to 1000 cells per second. However, accessing elastic as well as viscous properties of cells and multicellular systems in suspension as well as adhered to surfaces at high throughput has not been possible so far. In this thesis, I approached this question and developed as well as applied microfluidic and holographic technologies to analyze the viscoelastic properties of single cells and multicellular aggregates, respectively. First, I demonstrated that real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC) can be applied in transfusion medicine, where the highest quality standards have to be maintained while blood product release is time-critical. We showed for platelet and red blood cell concentrates as well as for hematopoietic stem cells that their mechanical properties can be used for label-free quality assessment. The results have been published in Lab on a Chip (Aurich et al. 2020). For RT-DC and many other methods based on hydrodynamic deformation, the constriction size has to be adapted to the objects of interest to allow for a shear-induced ..."

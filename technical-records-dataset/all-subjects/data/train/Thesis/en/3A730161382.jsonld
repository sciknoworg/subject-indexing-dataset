            "abstract": "This study based on the aim to contribute to the effective conservation of suitable tiger habitat by drawing habitat suitability map. We modeled habitat suitability using the empirical multivariate approach of the Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA). The principle of ENFA is to compute a suitability function by comparing environmental variable values of species presence cells with respective mean values of the entire study area. Independent data for the model came in form of ecogeographical variables (EGVs) on land use, topography and human-factors whereas tiger presence points formed the response variable. Landsat imagery and land cover classes from an existing map were used for producing a segmentation-based land use map. The study concentrated on the target period of November 2002 to May 2004, especially for the year 2003 when the tiger presence points were mostly detected. These points were collected based on camera trap survey and track and sign data. Remote sensing (RS) and geometric information systems (GIS) were used as tools to assess environmental variables relevant for habitat selection of tiger. The results indicated that the tigers avoid higher value of evergreen closed areas and areas close to settlements. They are essentially linked to large areas of evergreen open forests, kaing grass and closer distance to stream bed. Finally, this study strongly recommends a strict monitoring in the core zone in order to minimize threats in the future. The shape of the zones has to follow the areas of different habitat suitability values from the modeling. The applied model appears to be a very promising method to derive meaningful estimation of habitat suitability. The HS map as one of the major outcomes of the modeling can support wildlife managers in the development and implementation of conservation and protection measures for tigers as well as for other endangered species in the Hukaung Valley Tiger reserve.",

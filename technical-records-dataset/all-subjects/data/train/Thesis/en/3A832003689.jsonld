            "abstract": "Injection of nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) is an innovative technology for in situ installation of a permeable reactive barrier in the subsurface. Zerovalent iron (ZVI) is highly reactive with chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs) and renders them into less harmful substances. Application of nZVI instead of granular ZVI can increase rates of dechlorination of CHCs by orders of magnitude, due to its higher surface area. This approach is still difficult to apply due to fast agglomeration and sedimentation of colloidal suspensions of nZVI, which leads to very short transport distances. To overcome this issue of limited mobility, polyanionic stabilisers are added to increase surface charge and stability of suspensions. In field experiments maximum transport distances of a few metres were achieved. A new approach, which is investigated in this thesis, is enhanced mobility of nZVI by a more mobile carrier colloid. The investigated composite material consists of activated carbon, which is loaded with nZVI. In this cumulative thesis, transport characteristics of carbon-colloid supported nZVI (c-nZVI) are investigated. Investigations started with column experiments in 40 cm columns filled with various porous media to investigate on physicochemical influences on transport characteristics. The experimental setup was enlarged to a transport experiment in a 1.2-m-sized two-dimensional aquifer tank experiment, which was filled with granular porous media. Further, a field experiment was performed in a natural aquifer system with a targeted transport distance of 5.3 m. Parallel to these investigations, alternative methods for transport observations were investigated by using noninvasive tomographic methods. Experiments using synchrotron radiation and magnetic resonance (MRI) were performed to investigate in situ transport characteristics in a non-destructive way. Results from column experiments show potentially high mobility under environmental relevant conditions. Addition of mono-and bivalent salts, e.g. more than 0.5 mM/L CaCl2, might decrease mobility. Changes in pH to values below 6 can inhibit mobility at all. Measurements of colloid size show changes in the mean particle size by a factor of ten. Measurements of zeta potential revealed an increase of \u201362 mV to \u201382 mV. Results from the 2D-aquifer test system suggest strong particle deposition in the first centimetres and only weak straining in the further travel path and no gravitational influence on particle transport. Straining at the beginning of the travel path in the porous medium was observed with tomographic investigations of transport. MRI experiments revealed similar results to the previous experiments, and observations using synchrotron radiation suggest straining of colloids at pore throats. The potential for high transport distances, which was suggested from laboratory experiments, was confirmed in the field experiment, where the transport distance of 5.3 m was reached by at least 10% of injected nZVI. Altogether, transport distances of the investigated carbon-colloid supported nZVI are higher than published results of traditional nZVI",

            "abstract": "\"This historic publication brings to light the little known fact that the automobile was one of Frank Lloyd Wright's passions and that buying cars was one of his obsessions. Wright, through his Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, owned more cars and more different makes and models of cars than any other architect that ever lived. Wright purchased cars even when he was financially strapped and he often bought several cars at once. Nearly all of his cars were painted Cherokee red, regardless of their original factory color. ... Wright, thereby, turned his cars into Frank Lloyd Wright cars, irrespective of their make and model. ... Because photos of only a few of his cars are available, historic magazine ads that depict, in their illustrations, the year, make and model of each of his cars are used to describe them, thereby providing, in effect, a history of these cars as told via the automobile manufacturers' own magazine advertising.\"--Preface, page vii",

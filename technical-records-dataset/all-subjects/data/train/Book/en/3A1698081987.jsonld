                "\"Contributing to the fast growing new field of neutrosophy, this book provides a significant collection of unedited articles covering the latest ongoing research area. Neutrosopy is above all a new view on modelling, tailored to effectively address the uncertainties inherent of the real world. In short, Neutrosophy supersedes in logics the binary approach of true or false by introducing a third state: neutral, which can be also interpreted as indeterminate, uncertain, inconsistent .... Development of neutrosophy since its conception by Smarandache in 1988 exponentially grows by conceptual extensions of logics, measure, sets, graphs, as well as practical applications in namely all fields. It can be think as generalization of fuzzy logic and its variants like intuitionistic fuzzy logic. Registered in wide collection of books on this promising field, here we deliver to researchers, lecturers and postgraduate students pursuing research on neutrosophic a set of eighteen unreleased articles on state of the art theoretical developments, applications and understanding of neutrosophy\"--",

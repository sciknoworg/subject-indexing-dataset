                "This book provides a detailed history of meteorology as a natural science, from an understanding of the Earth's early atmosphere to present-day advancements. In three parts, the book synthesizes developments in quantitative meteorology starting from its very early stages and progressively covers the invention of basic meteorology instruments while highlighting the various turning points and key figures who played roles along the way. The first part addresses the treatment of meteorology during early civilization. Part two goes into the early development of meteorology as a science. Part three covers the science's rapid progression and present-day status while addressing the primary technologies and methodologies used in a variety of areas like weather forecasting, remote sensing, and radar instrumentation. The target audience for the book is students and researchers interested in the history of meteorology as a science, and also general enthusiasts of the subject who have some background on the topic."

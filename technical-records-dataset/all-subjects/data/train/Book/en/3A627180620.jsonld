                "\"Making Better Decisions: Decision Theory in Practice introduces readers to some of the principal ideas from decision theory and examines how they might help us make better decisions. The presentation is designed to appeal to students and the general reader; based on problems, readers are encouraged to imagine a situation, and then make a decision or a judgment. The problems are chosen to exemplify some principles developed in decision theory, as well as violations of these principles derived from the psychological literature. Making Better Decisions offers explanations of both the theories we would like to adopt in order to make better decisions, and the theories that explain how those around us behave. In doing so, the book presents crucial insights into the decision-making process that can influence and change our behavior and our ability to interact with those around us\"--"

            "abstract": "\"The future of any business from banking, e-commerce, real estate, homeland security, healthcare, marketing, the stock market, manufacturing, education, retail to government organizations depends on the data and analytics capabilities that are built and scaled. The speed of change in technology in recent years has been a real challenge for all businesses. To manage that, a significant number of organizations are exploring the BigData (BD) infrastructure that helps them to take advantage of new opportunities while saving costs. Timely transformation of information is also critical for the survivability of an organization. Having the right information at the right time will enhance not only the knowledge of stakeholders within an organization but also providing them with a tool to make the right decision at the right moment. It is no longer enough to rely on a sampling of information about the organizations' customers. The decision-makers need to get vital insights into the customers' actual behavior, which requires enormous volumes of data to be processed. We believe that Big Data infrastructure is the key to successful Artificial Intelligence (AI) deployments and accurate, unbiased real-time insights. Big data solutions have a direct impact and changing the way the organization needs to work with help from AI and its components ML and DL. In this article, we discuss these topics\"--",

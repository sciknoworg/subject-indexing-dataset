            "abstract": "All nutritionists, dietitians and health professionals interested in or dealing with those with food allergy should have a copy of this book, The prevalence of food allergy is increasing and consumers are now more aware of allergy and intolerance than ever, with retailers launching special ranges of foods suitable for people with particular allergies, and allergy featuring regularly in the media. Bringing together contributions from leading experts in food allergy, this book covers the latest developments in the field of food allergy and intolerance, including the major allergens nuts, milk, soya, seafood, and sesame, and foods to which intolerance is common - gluten, lactose and food additives. Technical aspects of allergens are covered, including the effect of cooking on allergenicity of proteins, the assessment of novel foods for allergenicity, development of a dipstick assay for allergens, and the food industry perspective on food allergy and intolerance. Consumers' first-hand experience of food allergy and intolerance are included, as well as the latest thinking behind sensitisation to allergens, both in utero and postnatally. All nutritionists, dietitians and health professionals interested in or dealing with those with food allergy should have a copy of this book, as well as universities and medical schools.  Professionals in the food industry, to whom food allergy is an important factor in all aspects of food manufacture, from product development and food labelling to good manufacturing practice, should not be without access to this book. This book is published in association with Leatherhead Food International",

            "abstract": "\"The integrated circuits are now growing its importance in every electronic system that needs an efficient VLSI architecture designs with low power consumption, compress chip area, speed, and operating frequency. The challenge for VLSI system designers is to optimize the hardware-software integration for lowering the total cost of acquisition of products. So, there is a demand for better technological solutions for advanced VLSI architectures that can be done through hardware description language (HDL). Verilog HDL is one of the programming languages that can give better solutions to this new era of the VLSI industry. The prefabrication design and analysis of such advanced VLSI architecture can be easily implemented with Verilog HDL with the available software tools like Xilinx and Cadence. The presented book mainly deals with fundamental concepts of digital design along with their design verification with Verilog HDL. The book will be a common source of knowledge for the beginners as well as research seeking students working in the area of VLSI design covering fundamentals of digital design from switch level to FPGA based implementation using hardware description language (HDL). The book is summarized in 10 chapters. Chapter 1 and 2 describes the fundamental concepts behind digital circuit design including combinational and sequential circuit design. Chapter 3 to chapter 8 is focused on sequential and combinational circuit design using Verilog HDL at a different level of abstractions in Verilog coding. Chapter 9 includes implementation of any logic function using a programmable logic device like PLD, CPLD or FPGA, etc. Chapter 10 covers a few real-time examples of digital circuit design using Verilog. Chapter 11 focuses on System Verilog, distinct features, computing Verilog and System Verilog with design example.\"",

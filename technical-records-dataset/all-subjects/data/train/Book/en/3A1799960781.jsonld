            "abstract": "A benchmark publication, the first edition of the Phosphor Handbook, published in 1998, set the standard for references in the field. The second edition, updated and published in 2007, began exploring new and emerging fields. However, in the last 14 years, since the second edition was published, many notable advances and broader phosphor applications have occurred. Completely revised, updated, and expanded into three separate volumes, this third edition of the Handbook covers the most recent developments in phosphor research, characterization, and applications. This volume on Novel Phosphors, Synthesis, and Applications' provides the descriptions of synthesis and optical properties of phosphors used in different applications, including the novel phosphors for some newly developed applications. The chapters in this book cover: Various LED-based phosphors and their synthesis and applications Ingenious integrated smart phosphors and their novel optoelectronic and photonic devices Quantum dot, single crystalline, and glass phosphors Upconversion nanoparticles for super-resolution imaging and photonic and biological applications Special phosphors for laser, OLED, energy storage, quantum cutting, thermometry, photosynthesis, AC-driven LED, and solar cells",

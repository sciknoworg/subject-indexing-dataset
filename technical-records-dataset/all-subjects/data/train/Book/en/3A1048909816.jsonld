Chris Bowden, Navigus Planning  Neighbourhood Planning (NP), introduced by the Localism Act of 2011, is the right for communities to decide the future of the places where they live and work. This book examines the experience of neighbourhood planners, analysing what communities have achieved, how they have done so and what went well or badly. Comparing NP with other forms of community planning and highlighting the main lessons learned so far, it acts as a navigation tool for people already involved in neighbourhood planning, as well as those contemplating participation."

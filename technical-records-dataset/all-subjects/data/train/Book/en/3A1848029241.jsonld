            "abstract": "\"Quantum Continuous Variables introduces the theory of continuous variable quantum systems, from its foundations based on the framework of Gaussian states to modern developments, including its applications to quantum information and forthcoming quantum technologies. This book addresses the theory of Gaussian states, operations, and dynamics in great depth and breadth, through a novel approach that embraces both the Hilbert space and phase descriptions. The second edition of this book has been revised throughout, and updated to include new topics, such as boson sampling, coherent feedback, nonlinear control, as well as several new solved problems. The volume includes coverage of entanglement theory and quantum information protocols, and their connection with relevant experimental set-ups. General techniques for non-Gaussian manipulations also emerge as the treatment unfolds and are demonstrated with specific case studies. This book will be of interest to graduate students looking to familiarise themselves with the field, in addition to experienced researchers eager to enhance their understanding of its theoretical methods. It will also appeal to experimentalists searching for a rigorous but accessible treatment of the theory in the area\"--",

                "\"Fast forward to today. Now we have data networks in place that allow us to transmit information to/from virtually any location on Earth (and even in outer space to a degree) in a timely and efficient manner. But what did this tremendous enhancement in communications technology bring us? Another place for criminal activity to take place. Who are these criminals in CyberSpace? You could start with organized crime...such as the Mafia and others. What is their major focus here? Financial activity of course...they have found a new way to \"mismanage\" the financial resources (among other things) of others. We also have foreign espionage activities making good use of our enhanced communication systems. They routinely break into government, military and commercial computer networked systems and steal trade secrets, new designs, new formulas, and so on\"--",
                "\"Penetration testing is used as a means to test the security of both private, government, military and corporate computer networks. Suitable for both the novice and the experienced professional, this book provides step-by-step procedures for using the mainly free commercially available tools to perform these tests of computer networks. Covering basic and advanced tools and procedures, the authors categorize tools according to their usage within the standard testing framework and demonstrate how to perform an organized and efficient penetration test. Readers will also learn techniques used to bypass anti-virus software and capture keystrokes of remote systems. \"--"

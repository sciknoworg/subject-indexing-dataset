Fractal-based techniques lie at the heart of this area, as fractals are inherently multiscale objects; they very often describe nonlinear phenomena better than traditional mathematical models. In many cases they have been used for solving inverse problems arising in models described by systems of differential equations and dynamical systems. \u00a1 \"Fractal-Based Methods in Analysis\" draws together, for the first time in book form, methods and results from almost twenty years of research in this topic, including new viewpoints and results in many of the chapters.\u00a1 For each topic the theoretical framework is carefully explained using examples and applications. \u00a1 The second chapter on basic iterated function systems theory is designed to be used as the basis for a course and includes many exercises.\u00a1 This chapter, along with the three background appendices on topological and metric spaces, measure theory, and basic results from set-valued analysis, make the book suitable for self-study or as a source book for a graduate course. The other chapters illustrate many extensions and applications of fractal-based methods to different areas. This book is intended for graduate students and researchers in applied mathematics, engineering and social sciences. \u00a1 Herb Kunze is a Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Guelph.\u00a1 Davide La Torre is an Associate Professor in the Department of Economics, Business and Statistics, University of Milan.\u00a1\u00a1 Franklin Mendivil is a Professor in the Department of\u00a1Mathematics and Statistics, Acadia University.\u00a1Edward R.

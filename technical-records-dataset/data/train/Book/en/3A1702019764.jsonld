                "This unique book introduces a variety of techniques designed to represent, enhance and empower multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional machine learning research in healthcare informatics. Providing a unique compendium of current and emerging machine learning paradigms for healthcare informatics, it reflects the diversity, complexity, and the depth and breadth of this multi-disciplinary area. Further, it describes techniques for applying machine learning within organizations and explains how to evaluate the efficacy, suitability, and efficiency of such applications. Featuring illustrative case studies, including how chronic disease is being redefined through patient-led data learning, the book offers a guided tour of machine learning algorithms, architecture design, and applications of learning in healthcare challenges.",

                "Pterocarpus santalinus L.f., popularly known as Red Sanders, an endemic tree, belonging to the family Fabaceae is confined to the southern parts of Eastern Ghats. IUCN has listed this tree as endangered. The plant has superlative characteristics in its wood and has many medicinal properties. This plant has attracted the attention of both foresters and lay man because of its high valued wood which is being illegally harvested creating law and order problem. This book is a comprehensive monograph on Red Sanders and is divided into 15 chapters. The book provides information on taxonomy, morphology, distribution, wood anatomy, wood properties and uses, dye principle, phytochemistry, pharmacology, Silvicultural aspects, propagation, cultivation practices, reproductive biology, pests and diseases, biotechnology, molecular studies, conservation, trade, commerce, socioeconomic aspects of Red Sanders, and grey areas of research. The book is profusely illustrated with colour photographs and line drawings. Relevant references have been provided under each chapter. This monograph on Red Sanders with systematic representation of information and illustrations will be a desk reference and field guide to foresters, botanists, researchers, farmers, traders and environmentalists",

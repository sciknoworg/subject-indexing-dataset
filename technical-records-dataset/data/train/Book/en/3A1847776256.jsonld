            "abstract": "\"Pests cause economic damage to crop and stored products, while vectors are responsible for transmission of disease-causing agents in human beings and livestock. Application of synthetic pesticides in agriculture though has given immediate relief but has also caused well known side effects, leading to a consensus among entomologists and agriculturists to shift towards other ecofriendly pest management. Insect natural enemies consisting of predators, parasitoids and pathogens have attracted the attention of scientists across the globe. These natural enemies exist in agroecosystems and suppress the populations of pests. Parasitoids are farmers' friends and most successful group of natural enemies. Highly specialized in their host choice, female parasitoid searches for a suitable host to lay eggs and larvae in or on or near the hosts. Exploiting this potency of parasitoids may yield successful results in controlling notorious pests in an ecofriendly way. This book covers information on the important biocontrol agents effective in pest suppression. It starts with insect parasitic groups followed by specific group of parasitoids. It is hoped that the book presents a comprehensive account of beneficial parasitoids and will be useful to Undergraduate and Postgraduate students of Entomology, Biological Control, Plant Protection, Agricultural Zoology and Zoology, besides those involved in competitive examinations and policy planning. Features Each chapter has been written by specialized senior persons. Every chapter contains Learning Objectives and Points to Remember. This book offers comprehensive knowledge of parasitoids and their application in pest management in a lucid way\"--",

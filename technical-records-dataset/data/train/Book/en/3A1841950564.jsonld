                "\u201cSwitzerland has always been a haven of stability and security. But the Swiss financial marketplace is in the midst of immense changes brought on by the changing global environment. Whether you are a Swiss banker or a Swiss banking client, this book will serve you as an indispensable companion and guide to the Finanzplatz Schweiz.\u201d --Guy Spier, Value Invester, Switzerland This open access book provides a thorough explanation of Swiss financial markets and the banking secrecy rules for which this country has become known. It covers key topics, which are essential for practitioners and academics to understand about this powerhouse in world financial markets, in general, and private wealth administration, in particular. If there were an overriding goal, it would be to answer this question: \u201cHow could a small country in the middle of Europe and surrounded by economic and financial giants, like Germany and France, develop financial markets that are globally competitive?\u201d Swiss Finance explains the dramatic pressures brought to bear on the Swiss financial markets during past two decades, perhaps none of them so great as the competitive challenges caused by changes in Switzerland's banking secrecy laws and practices, as well the shifting tide of new wealth generation toward Asia (e.g., China, Singapore, and South Korea) and large emerging markets. In doing so, it separates myth from reality, providing an excellent basis for predicting future changes the nation will need to make in order to stay competitive. Henri B.

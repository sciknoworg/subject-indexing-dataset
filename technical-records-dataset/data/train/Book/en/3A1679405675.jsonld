            "abstract": "\"Historically, British chemistry has been perceived as a solely male endeavour. However, this perception is untrue: the allure of chemistry has attracted British women for centuries past. Since the 1880s, women chemists have studied academic chemistry and made interesting and significant contributions to their fields, yet they have been absent from the historical record. This book rectifies the gaps, providing a well-researched glimpse into the forgotten world of British women in chemistry from 1880-1949. This title showcases the determination of these women to survive and flourish in their chosen field. The authors show how women were fascinated by chemistry long before the modern era; unravelled the complex saga of chemistry at girls' secondary schools; found the other avenues by which women chemists pursued their love of the subject; and discovered a unifying passion for chemistry and poetry that extended from grade school to university and industrial employment\"--",

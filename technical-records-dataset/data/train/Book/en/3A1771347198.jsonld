            "abstract": "\"This book explores how Victorian cemeteries were the direct result of the socio-cultural, economic, and political context of the city, and were part of a unique transformation process that emerged in London at the time. The book shows how the re-ordering of the city's burial spaces, along with the principles of health and hygiene, were directly associated with liberal capital investments, which had consequences in the spatial arrangement of London. Victorian cemeteries, in particular, were not only a solution for overcrowded graveyards; they also acted as urban generators in the formation London's suburbs in the nineteenth century. Beginning with an analysis of the conditions that triggered the introduction of the early Victorian cemeteries in London, this book investigates their spatial arrangement, aesthetics, and functions. These developments are illustrated through the study of three private Victorian burial sites: Kensal Green Cemetery, Highgate Cemetery, and Brookwood Cemetery. The book is aimed to students and researchers of London history, planning and environment, Victorian and death culture studies\"--",

                "\"Naturally derived products and their derivatives have strongly influenced everyday life. They dominate almost every field of applied sectors ranging from medicine, food, fodder, perfume, spice, dyes and for miscellaneous purposes throughout the world due to their enthusiastic performance. Furthermore, scientists have needed to communicate and discuss the relevance of their works on the latest demands of the current era. During the last few decades more and more new alternative aspects based on naturally derived functional materials have been searched on account of increased awareness of product safety and high attention to the possible adverse impacts of synthetic based ready-to-use products on human health. So, there should be a multidisciplinary effort via technological perspectives to perform further research towards new opportunities, to develop new sustainable products\"--"

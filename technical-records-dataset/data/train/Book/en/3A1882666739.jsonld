                "This textbook introduces quantum computing to readers who do not have much background in linear algebra based on the self-study experience of the author as an engineer. The author targets undergraduate and master students who are willing to spend about 60 -90 hours seriously learning quantum computing. This book is also suitable for self-study and teaching videos for each chapter and more than 200 exercises with answers are provided. Readers will be able to write their program to simulate quantum computing algorithms and run on real quantum computers on IBM-Q. Moreover, unlike books that only give superficial, \u201chand-waving\u201d explanations, this book uses exact formalism so readers can continue to pursue more advanced topics based on what they learn from this book. Uses narrative to start each section with analogies that help students to grasp the critical concept quickly; Uses numerical substitutions, accompanied by Python programming and IBM-Q quantum computer programming, as examples in teaching all critical concepts; Teaching videos and more than 200 exercises with answers are provided."

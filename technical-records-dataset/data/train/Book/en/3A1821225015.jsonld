            "abstract": "\"This textbook is designed for undergraduate students studying airspace engineering, as well as undergraduate and postgraduate students studying air transport management. It will also be very helpful for the training of air traffic control officers. The textbook does not require any prior (specialist) knowledge as it is an introduction to the Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) business. There is very little literature available that gives a detailed appreciation of the complexities, potential risks and issues associated with the provision of air navigation services. The role of this textbook is to fill this significant gap with a comprehensive, in-depth study of the management principles related to Air Navigation Service Providers. This is particularly timely given recent ATC developments in Europe, USA, and New Zealand. Airlines and airports rely on the Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) for the management of air traffic. Hence, Air Navigation Services (ANS) provision is considered as a core element for air transportation. This textbook addresses each of the Air Navigation Services' five broad categories of services provided to air traffic during all phases of operation: Air Traffic Management (ATM), Communication services, Navigation services and Surveillance services (CNS), Meteorological services for air navigation (MET), Aeronautical Information Services (AIS) and Search and Rescue (SAR). This textbook is designed for undergraduate students studying airspace engineering and undergraduate and postgraduate students studying air transport management. It will also be very helpful for the training of air traffic control officers. The textbook does not require any prior (specialist) knowledge as it is an introduction book to the Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) business.\"",

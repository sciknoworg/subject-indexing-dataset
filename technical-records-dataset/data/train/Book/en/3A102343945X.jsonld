                "'This second edition of the Handbook of Research on Techno-Entrepreneurship, edited by Fran\u00e7ois Th\u00e9rin, evidences a burgeoning field of research, and a growing cohort of international researchers working in this field who have produced works for this volume. The papers cover a variety of topics that intersect the realm of technovation with other fields of enquiry, such as economic development, sustainability, venture capital, new venture incubation, and academic entrepreneurship. This Handbook represents a convenient place to find and read this broad array of recent papers in this field.' - Evan J. Douglas, Griffith Business School, Australia. 'In this Handbook, Fran\u00e7ois Th\u00e9rin assembles a group of researchers with diverse perspectives to enrich our understanding of the nature, antecedents and consequences of techno-entrepreneurship. The Handbook is comprehensive in its scope, deep in its analyses, informative and interesting to read. It opens many avenues for research while communicating well with managers and policy makers.' - Shaker A. Zahra, University of Minnesota, US. Techno-entrepreneurship is broadly defined as the entrepreneurial and intrapreneurial activities of both existing and nascent companies operating in technology-intensive environments. This second edition examines the latest trends in techno-entrepreneurship. Comprising entirely new contributions by international experts, this edition covers among others: family business, green and sustainable techno-entrepreneurship, effectuation, techno-intrapreneurship, academic entrepreneurship, frugal innovation. With chapters focusing on China, India, Southeast Asia and South America, the Handbook explores views on the new hot spots in techno-entrepreneurship development. Providing a comprehensive, highly accessible and innovative first insight into the developing sphere of techno-entrepreneurship, this international study will be essential reading for postgraduate students, academics and researchers with an interest in management and entrepreneurship. Managerial and entrepreneurial professionals in high-tech industries will also find much to interest them within this Handbook"

            "abstract": "Bioparticles surround us in many areas of daily life. They are used, for example, in plant cultivation, the food industry or for environmental applications. The characterization of these particles is a challenge due to their small size. The present work therefore deals with the development and investigation of novel multispectral imaging techniques for the characterization and sorting of bioparticles in microfluidic flow. For this purpose, innovative microfluidic structures were tested to place particles in the focal plane of the optical system by controlled fluid rotation. These structures build the basis for optical characterization and image-based sorting at the single particle level. Microalgae of the type Haematococcus pluvialis (HP) were used as model organism for the investigations as well as for the subsequent image-based sorting. These microalgae are cultivated in a two-step process, where they change their morphological as well as their spectral properties if they are exposed to external stress factors. Such characteristics make them interesting for multispectral imaging analysis. During the development and optimization of biotechnological cultivation processes, continuous monitoring of the spectral and morphological properties of the cells is an important quality pa-rameter. Due to the large number of cells analyzed at the single cell level per measurement, pre-cise information about the physiological state of the cells as well as the composition of the entire population is possible. With the novel universally applicable multispectral imaging platform, several thousand particles per minute could be captured and classified. By implementing real-time classification, the entire analysis process could be significantly accelerated and automated. The measured values of the multispectral imaging correlate with the measured values of the chemically extracted dyes in the particles.",

                "This book is a compilation of scientific articles written by recognized researchers, and select students, participating in the Second Conference on the Study of Complex Systems and their Applications (EDIESCA 2021). EDIESCA 2021 arose from the need for academic and research groups that carry out this scientific research to disseminate their results internationally. The study and characterization of systems with non-linear and/or chaotic behavior has been of great interest to researchers around the world, for which many important results have been obtained with various applications. The dynamic study of chaotic oscillators of different models, such as R\u00f6ssler, Lorenz, and Chua, has generated important advances in understanding of chemical reactions, meteorological behavior, design of electronic devices, and other applications. Topics at the event included applications for communications systems by masking techniques, financial behavior, networks analysis, nonlinear lasers, numerical modeling, electronic design, and other interesting topics in the area of complex systems. Additionally, there are results on numerical simulation and electronic designs to generate complex dynamic behaviors."

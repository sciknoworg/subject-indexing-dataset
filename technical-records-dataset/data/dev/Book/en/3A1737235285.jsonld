            "abstract": "\"Change Management for Risk Professionals addresses a need in the marketplace. Since organizations are contantly changing, so too do the risks. In addition to this, while these organizational changes are generally intentional-directed, planned, and even mapped out by senior leadership-often the resultant changes and risks are unforeseen and unanticipated. The book focuses on the dynamics of change management with an eye toward the risk professional. It will help in the planning of change in managing through it as well as in the decision-making and migration to a the \"new norm.\" Oftentimes risk management professionals are not intimately acquainted with change and change dynamics, despite the fact that they are required to plan for the unexpected. Likewise, change management professionals are not often tasked with looking at the overall risks-including unanticipated challenges, hurdles, or even barriers-that present themselves in a changing environment. The author brings his extensive experience to bear in offering advice, suggestions, industry examples, and best practices to the change management process. The book presents tricks of the trade, and industry insight, into how organizations can migrate from their current environment to the new, desired one with minimal risk and disruption, thereby optimally maintaining flexibility, continuity, and production. Change Management for Risk Professionals will be a welcome addition to enterprise-wide business continuity, crisis management, disaster recovery, and security management and homeland security professionals, their organizations, and their operations.\"",

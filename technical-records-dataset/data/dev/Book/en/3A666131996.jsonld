                "\"Timothy and Linda O'Leary and the Computer Information Technology Team at McGraw-Hill Higher Education offer your students a fully integrated learning program with time-tested quality and reliability. Office 2010: A Case Approach offers running case study throughout the text to help students understand the material in a consistent, relevant environment. Through this theme of \"Making Office Relevant,\" this text helps students understand why they need this course and these skills. Student success is assured through clear step-by-step instruction, plentiful screen captures and conceptual explanations. Each Lab, designed to be covered in 1 hour of class time, combines conceptual coverage with detailed software-specific instructions. Each Lab opens with a running case study that highlights real-world applications of each software program and leads students from problem to solution. The O'Leary Series helps students learn specific applications skills along with those that cross all Office applications, which is especially important in mastering this version of Office. The O'Leary Series also correlates with SimNet Online, our online training and assessment program for Office 2010\"--",
                "\"The goal of the O'Leary Series is to provide you with the necessary skills to efficiently use these applications. Equally important is the goal to provide a foundation for students to readily and easily learn to use future versions of this software. This series does this by providing detailed step-by-step instructions combined with careful selection and presentation of essential concepts. Times are changing, technology is changing, and this text is changing too. As students of today, you are different from those of yesterday. You put much effort toward the things that interest you and the things that are relevant to you. Your efforts directed at learning application programs and exploring the Web seem, at times, limitless. The mission of the series is to build upon and extend this interest by not only teaching the specific application skills but by introducing the concepts that are common to all applications, providing students with the confidence, knowledge, and ability to easily learn the next generation of applications\"--"

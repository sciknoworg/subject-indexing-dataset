                "\"In this volume, several new food processing and preservation technologies have been investigated by researchers that have the potential to increase shelf life and preserve the quality of foods. This handbook introduces some emerging techniques in the food processing sector, focusing on nonthermal techniques such as high-pressure processing, ultrasonication of foods, microwave vacuum dehydration, thermoelectric refrigeration technology, advanced methods of encapsulation, ozonation, electrospinning, and mechanical expellers for dairy, food, and agricultural processing. These all have a wide range of application. The volume includes studies that show the successful application of these new technologies on a large number of juices, cheeses, yogurts, soups, egg whites and eggs, vegetable slices, purees, and milk, and the extraction, drying enhancement, and modification of enzymes are reported. This volume, part of the multi-volume Handbook of Research on Food Processing and Preservation Technologies will have tremendous application in different areas of the food industry, including food processing, preservation, safety, and quality evaluation. Other volumes of this handbook cover a wide of other emerging technologies. Handbook of Research on Food Processing and Preservation Technologies, Volume 2: Nonthermal Food Preservation and Novel Processing Strategies is an excellent reference resource for researchers, scientists, faculty and students, growers, traders, processors, industries, and others for looking for new nonthermal approaches for food processing and preservation\"--"

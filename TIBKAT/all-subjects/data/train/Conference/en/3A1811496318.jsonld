            "title": "Technology and science for the ships of the future : proceedings of NAV 2018, 19th International Conference on Ship & Maritime Research",
            "abstract": "In 1974, a scientific conference covering marine automation group and large vessels issues was organized under the patronage of the Technical Naval Studies Centre (CETENA) and the Italian National Research Council (CNR). A later collaboration with the Marine Technical Association (ATENA) led to the renaming of the conference as NAV, extending the topics covered to the technical field previously covered by ATENA national conferences. The NAV conference is now held every 3 years, and attracts specialists from all over the world. This book presents the proceedings of NAV 2018, held in Trieste, Italy, in June 2018. The book contains 70 scientific papers, 35 technical papers and 16 reviews, and subjects covered include: comfort on board; conceptual and practical ship design; deep sea mining and marine robotics; protection of the environment; renewable marine energy; design and engineering of offshore vessels; digitalization, unmanned vehicles and cyber security; yacht and pleasure craft design and inland waterway vessels. With its comprehensive coverage of scientific and technical maritime issues, the book will be of interest to all those involved in this important industry",

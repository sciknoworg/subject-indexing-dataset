                "\"The automotive industry requirements for vehicle weight reduction, weight containment, improved part functionality and passenger safety have resulted in the increased use of steel grades with a fully martensitic microstructure. These steel grades are essential to improve the anti-intrusion resistance of automotive body parts and the related passenger safety during car collisions. Standard advanced high strength steel (AHSS) grades are notoriously difficult to be press formed; they are characterized by elastic springback, poor stretch flangeability and low hole expansion ratios. Hot press forming has therefore received much attention recently as an alternative technology to produce AHSS automotive parts. In this book, selected articles from the Fourth International Conference on Advanced High Strength Steel and Press Hardening held on August 20-22th, 2018 in Hefei, China, are compiled. It focuses on AHSS for the development of sheet metal hot forming for lightweight vehicle, advanced digital manufacturing technology, as well as the physical metallurgy principles of the hot press forming process. The effect of composition on hot press forming steels is discussed taking the deformation during press forming into account. Furthermore, the effect of the static strain ageing processes occurring during the paint baking cycle on the in-service mechanical properties of press hardened steel will be presented. The influence of temperate and strain rate on the flow stress during press forming and the final room temperature mechanical properties will also be discussed\"--",

            "abstract": "Among the optical effects that are intensively investigated in recent decades is the phenomenon of self-action of light beams in nonlinear optical media, which is characterized by a refractive index depending on the intensity of the light wave (e.g. self-trapping and self-focusing of optical beams, self-phase modulation of optical pulses etc.). The interaction of the light with a nonlinear material allows to realize the direct optical conversion of images and to control the space-time light structure. The formations of localized spatial structures, so-called optical solitons, which are solutions of the nonlinear differential equations describing such phenomena, are the focus of scientific and practical interest [1-6]. The reason for these intensive studies of solitons is the possibility of their use in modern communication systems, like high-speed systems of fiber-optical information transfer, including self-trapping structure formation due to nonlinear optical effects, creation of waveguiding optical elements with tunable characteristics etc. Owing to diffraction, a collimated beam of light with a diameter d usually spreads with an angle of ? / d. However, already almost 50 years ago it was found that this spreading could be avoided in a nonlinear optical medium, which possesses an intensity-dependent index of refraction that increases with light intensity [7-9]. As a result, the beam forms a dielectric waveguide for itself with solitons as self-trapping solutions.",

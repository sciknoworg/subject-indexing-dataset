This book focuses on the relationship and interdependence between design, theory, and history for an innovative and holistic studio approach. Rather than suggest a singular narrative, this book draws from a diverse range of thinkers and designers to highlight the many interpretations of key architectural concepts, and provides readers with the context essential for developing their own approaches to any design problem. Building Meaning is organized to reflect the typical studio process, with stand-alone chapters that provide flexibility for use at any stage of design. The ideal book for beginning and intermediate architecture students, it gives specific methods to apply in the studio to make the most of the design process, as well as focused exercises to creatively explore each concept presented. Illustrated with over 200 color images, it enables readers to engage and understand critically the genesis of architectural ideas and their role in our social and cultural experience\"--",

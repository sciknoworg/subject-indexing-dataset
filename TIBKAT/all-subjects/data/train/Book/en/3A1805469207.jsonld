            "abstract": "\"An essential text with a unique focus on RF and microwave engineering theory and its applications In RF/Microwave Engineering and Applications in Energy Systems, accomplished researcher Abdullah Eroglu delivers a detailed treatment of key theoretical aspects of radio-frequency and microwave engineering concepts along with parallel presentations of their practical applications. The text includes coverage of recent advances in the subject, including energy harvesting methods, RFID antenna designs, HVAC system controls, and smart grids. The distinguished author provides step-by-step solutions to common engineering problems by way of numerous examples and offers end-of-chapter problems and solutions on each topic. These practical applications of theoretical subjects aid the reader with retention and recall and demonstrate a solid connection between theory and practice. The author also applies common simulation tools in several chapters, illustrating the use and implementation of time domain circuit simulators in conjunction with electromagnetic simulators, as well as Matlab for design, simulation, and implementation at the component and system levels. Readers will also benefit from: A thorough introduction to the foundations of electromagnetics, including line, surface, and volume integrals, vector operation and theorems, and Maxwell's equations Comprehensive explorations of passive and active components in RF and microwave engineering, including resistors, capacitors, inductors, and semiconductor materials and active devices Practical discussions of transmission lines, including transmission line analysis, Smith charts, microstrip lines, and striplines In-depth examinations of network parameters, including impedance parameters, ABCD parameters, h-Hybrid parameters, and network connections Perfect for senior-level undergraduates and graduate students studying RF or Microwave engineering, RF/Microwave Engineering and Applications in Energy Systems is also an indispensable resource for professionals whose work touches on radio-frequency and microwave technologies.\"--",

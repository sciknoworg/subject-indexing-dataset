                "\"In the early years of its conception, J Robert Oppenheimer spoke of quantum theory as a subject that was \"unlikely to be known to any poet or historian.\" Yet, as Bernstein notes, in just sixty-odd years, one can find at least nine million entries on Google under the rubric \"quantum theory\" -- from poets and historians, as well as film critics and Buddhist monks. How did quantum mechanics enter general culture so pervasively? Having lived with the subject for most of its history, Jeremy Bernstein returns in this second edition to regale readers with a witty insider's perspective on the development of quantum theory as well as its loopholes. It is also a scintillating account of the interplay between brilliance and fallibility in humankind, even in the key figures who have shaped common understanding of quantum theory -- such eminent figures include Niels Bohr, the Dalai Lama, Tom Stoppard, and most notably, John Bell who made pioneering contributions in quantum physics as an underappreciated physicist. At once thought-provoking and intellectual, this semi-autobiographical popular science book is highly recommended for readers with rudimentary knowledge of science history, philosophy, and naturally, physics\"--",

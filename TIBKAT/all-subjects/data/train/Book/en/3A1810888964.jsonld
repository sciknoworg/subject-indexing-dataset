            "abstract": "\"This book examines policy responses to food waste and loss, an issue of significant, global concern, with one-third of food produced for human consumption lost or wasted. Investigating food waste and loss under an interdisciplinary lens, the contributors employ a variety of methodological approaches, including quantitative and qualitative techniques, drawing on in-depth case studies and action research. Organised into two parts, the first part is introductory and comprises three chapters investigating the measurement, drivers, consequences and costs of food waste and loss. The second part provides an overview of a range of programmes aiming to prevent and reduce food waste and loss undertaken by international and intergovernmental institutions, national and local governments, and private actors. International FAO and EU programmes are examined, as are national case studies from Asia, Latin America and Europe, and local programmes within European cities. By focusing on different territories and different levels of governance, the book provides a detailed evaluation of food loss and waste policies, the barriers and opportunities of implementing the policies, as well as the impact they are actually having. The chapters are both descriptive and evaluative and draw out lessons for designing, implementing and reforming programmes. This book will be of great interest to students and scholars working on food waste, food policy, sustainable food systems, agricultural production and supply chains and public policy, as well as policymakers involved with developing and implementing programmes and policies to regulate and reduce food waste and loss\"--",

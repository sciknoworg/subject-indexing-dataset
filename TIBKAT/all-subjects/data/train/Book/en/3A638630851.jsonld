This work provides a useful and up-to-date reference by compiling in a single book a description of the state of the art across a broad range of laser technologies. The book emphasizes phenomenology over first principles derivations to streamline the presentation and enable discussion of applications. Its level is appropriate for professional engineers who have some background in optics and light-particle interactions, but are not necessarily experts in lasers. The book also serves as a supplementary course or reference material for advanced undergraduates or graduate students\"--",

The standard for project construction of \u201cTechnical Code for Monitoring of Building Structures in Qinghai Province\u201d is the first standard for building structure monitoring engineering in China, which integrates design, construction and acceptance of monitoring technique. It can be applied to any place in the world not limited to Qinghai. The standard specifies the warning thresholds for various building structure monitoring parameters. In the monitoring technology, advanced monitoring technologies such as structure group, cloud platform, and BIM are adopted. It has strong operability for monitoring building structures according to the requirement of the standard, provides technical support for ensuring the safety of building structure, and fills in the blank of building structure safety monitoring technology in high and cold high-altitude areas. It contains specific measures to implement housing security for the first time, which is one of the \u201ctwo without worries and three guarantees\u201d proposed by General Secretary Xi Jinping. It is also used as a reference book for senior undergraduate and graduate students in colleges and universities",

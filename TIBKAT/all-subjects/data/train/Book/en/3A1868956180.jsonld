            "abstract": "\"Cooperative Enterprises is the first textbook to examine the evolution of cooperative enterprise model and the contribution that cooperatives can make to the economy and society. It provides an accessible overview of the subject, looking at history, cooperative models, theories, legislation and governance. Cooperative Enterprises takes an international approach throughout, drawing on examples from cooperatives from across the globe. The book offers a valuable historical perspective, placing cooperatives within their political, social, cultural and economic context since the industrial revolution. It analyses and compares the cooperative law of 26 jurisdictions. It showcases key defining moments for cooperative enterprises, cooperative development models, cooperative-specific good practice standards, and compares the cooperative model with the private enterprise model giving readers a comprehensive view of the subject. The book also demonstrates that cooperatives correct the market, complement the role of the state, support local economic development, reduce income and wealth inequalities, and promote social cohesion. Students are supported with a range of pedagogical features, including case studies, tables, figures, chapter summaries, and discussion questions to encourage critical thinking. This is the ideal textbook for undergraduate and postgraduate courses on cooperative studies, and will also be an illuminating resource for students, researchers and policymakers interested in social enterprise, business history, economic history, corporate governance, economic democracy and community development\"--",

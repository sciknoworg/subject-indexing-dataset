                "\"Most of the pipelines used for transport of varied fluids are susceptible to biofilms, and undesirable accumulation of microorganism in pipelines leads to biodeterioration and increase the maintenance cost of the pipelines. This book focusses on nanostructured polymetallic coatings for corrosion and biofouling protection in offshore oil and gas pipelines, marine pipelines, ship structures and port facilities, and corrosion resistance surface of several engineered structures. Impressing upon various reasons of biofouling in pipelines that transport crude and refined petroleum, gas, biofuels, other fluids including sewage, slurry, water for drinking or irrigation, the underlying mechanism is thoroughly explained. A comparison of various protective techniques is also highlighted for choice of methods for specific applications. Features: Provides information on biofouling control with broad significance and applicability in various industrial and research areas. Discusses microbially induced corrosion on biofuel transporting pipelines. Includes data from experiments conducted to overcome a biofouling and biocorrosion. Gives out particular attention to metallic coatings and environmental considerations. Explores novel technologies preventing biofouling on metallic and polymeric substrates. This book aims at researchers and graduate students in Coatings and paints, Microbiology, Bioprocess Engineering, Biotechnology, Industrial Engineering, Mechanical and Chemical Engineering, Marine Engineering, Surface & Corrosion Engineering, and Water and Wastewater Treatment\"--",

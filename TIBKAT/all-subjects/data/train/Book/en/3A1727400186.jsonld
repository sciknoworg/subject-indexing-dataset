                "\"This volume focuses on food preservation prior to distribution and sale, which is a major challenge in the tropical climates of most developing nations. In order to assure that food products are safe for human consumption, due importance must be given to the quality and safety aspects of production, processing, and distribution. This volume provides an informative overview of recent research on the therapeutic potential of various new and natural compounds along with novel technologies for enhanced shelf-life longevity and food safety. It also looks at the antimicrobial constituents of different sources and the history of their use as biopreservatives. It includes scientific evaluations of their use as alternative or potential biopreservatives. Focusing on real-life applications in consumer and food products, the book is divided into three parts, covering health and quality aspects of food preservation, applications of novel biomolecules for quality and safety of foods, and novel research techniques in food biopreservation. Key features: Discusses traditional natural compounds and modern technologies to reduce the spoilage of food products Looks at the therapeutics and their mechanism of actions of biological compounds for food safety Reports on new developments and novel strategies for food safety and quality improvement Novel Strategies to Improve Shelf-Life and Quality of Foods: Quality, Safety, and Health Aspects will be a useful reference for faculty and advanced students in food science as well as for food industry quality practitioners and other industry professionals in the food and dairy industries\"--"

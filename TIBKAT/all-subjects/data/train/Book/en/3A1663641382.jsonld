            "abstract": "\"Visual Basic has been a widely used programming language since its introduction in 1991. Its latest incarnation, Visual Basic 2017, brings continued refinement of the language. Visual Basic programmers are enthusiastically embracing the powerful capabilities of the language. Likewise, students learning their first programming language will find VB 2017 the ideal tool to understand the development of computer programs. My objectives when writing this text were as follows: 1. To develop focused chapters. Rather than covering many topics superficially, I concentrate on important subjects and cover them thoroughly. 2. To use examples and exercises with which students can relate, appreciate, and feel comfortable. I frequently use real data. Examples do not have so many embellishments that students are distracted from the programming techniques illustrated. 3. To produce compactly written text that students will find both readable and informative. The main points of each topic are discussed first and then the peripheral details are presented as comments. 4. To teach good programming practices that are in step with modern programming methodology. Problem solving techniques and structured programming are discussed early and used throughout the book.The style follows object-oriented programming principles. 5. To provide insights into the major applications of computers\"--Provided by publisher",

                "As we know, rapid industrialization is a serious concern in the context of a healthy environment and public health due to the generation of huge volumes of toxic wastewater. Although various physico-chemical and biological approaches are available for the treatment of this wastewater, many of them are not effective. Now, there a number of emerging ecofriendly, cost-effective approaches utilizing microorganisms (bacterial/fungi/algae), green plants or their enzymes, and constructed wetland treatment systems in the treatment of wastewaters containing pollutants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals, toxic metals, pesticides, dyes, petroleum hydrocarbons and phenolic compounds. This book provides a much-needed, comprehensive overview of the various types of wastewater and their ecotoxicological effects on the environment, humans, animals and plants as well as various emerging and eco-friendly approaches for their treatment. It provides insights into the ecological problems and challenges in the treatment and management of wastewaters generated by various sources.",

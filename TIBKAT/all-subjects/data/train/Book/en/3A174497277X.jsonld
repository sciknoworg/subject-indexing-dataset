                "The phenomenon of women's entrepreneurship has gained significant momentum across the globe. Written by leading scholars from a wide range of countries, this book advances the understanding of women's entrepreneurship by drawing attention to the contexts in which they operate. It is the fifth in the series of books produced in partnership with the Diana International Research Network. In this book, expert contributors explore female potential and how entrepreneurs make decisions within a multi-layered gendered context. As a rare and current overview of women's entrepreneurship, it presents evidence of the positive impact that achieving equality in gendered institutions would have, how to facilitate meso-institutions' impact and how to foster entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial initiative at the individual level. A crucial discussion of how women's entrepreneurship could benefit from a more comprehensive concept of innovation or implementing entrepreneurial policies focused on women is also included. With its focus on advancing knowledge about gender issues within the business realm, Women's Entrepreneurship in Global and Local Contexts will be of interest to researchers, faculty and students as well as policy-makers and practitioners",

                "In this text, George Wypych provides a comprehensive reference guide to help those working with plastics to limit this damage and deterioration through the use of UV stabilizers. The author begins with physics of radiation energy, transmission, and absorption and their effect on materials",
                "This book, the second edition of the first monograph fully devoted to UV degradation and stabilization ever published in English, has 12 chapters discussing different aspects of UV related phenomena occurring when polymeric materials are exposed to UV radiation.In the introduction the existing literature has been reviewed to find out how plants, animals and humans protect themselves against UV radiation. This review permits evaluation of mechanisms of protection against UV used by living things and potential application of these mechanisms in protection of natural and synthetic polymeric materials. This is followed by chapters with a more detailed look at more specific aspects of UV degradation and stabilization. A practical and up-to-date reference guide for engineers and scientists designing with plastics, and formulating plastics materialsExplains the effects of UV light on plastics, and how to mitigate its effects through the use of UV stabilizersSurveys the range of UV stabilizers on the market, and provides advice on their selection and use George Wypych has a Ph.D. in chemical engineering. His professional expertise includes both university teaching (full professor) and research and development. He has published 18 books, 47 scientific papers, and he has obtained 16 patents. He specializes in polymer additives, polymer processing and formulation, material durability and the development of sealants and coatings."

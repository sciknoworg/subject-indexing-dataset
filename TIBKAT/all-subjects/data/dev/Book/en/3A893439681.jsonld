                "Many of Barth's theological themes, such as revelation and election, have received numerous scholarly examinations, while Barth's doctrine of the church has been largely ignored. Yet, Barth entitled his massive systematic theological opus the Church Dogmatics, and the church was a central element of his thought from first to last. This book seeks to fill a lacuna in studies of Barth's doctrine of the church in over three decades. The author examines Barth's ecclesiological thought, from his early theological treatises to his massive unfinished dogmatics, in light of his interpretation with both Roman Catholicism and Protestant Liberalism. A special emphasis is placed upon Barth's mature ecclesiology in the Church Dogmatics",
                "Introduction -- Part One: Barth's early ecclesiology. Barth's early theology: battles on the left and on the right -- The path to the ecclesiology of the Church dogmatics -- Part Two: Barth's mature ecclesiology. The election of Jesus Christ: the foundation of ecclesiology -- Reconciliation as the context of ecclesiology -- The origin of the church as the fellowship of the Spirit -- The order of the church as the Body of Christ -- The ordination of the church as the people of God in the world -- Looking back and looking ahead"

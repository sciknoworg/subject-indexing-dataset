# üìö Welcome to the Subject Indexing Dataset Repository!

## üí° About

This dataset empowers the research community ü§ù to build advanced LLM-based semantic solutions for automated subject indexing and classification üìë of technical records from a German national library. The records are mainly in German or English but not limited to these languages. For the subject taxonomy, we rely on the [GND](https://www.dnb.de/EN/Professionell/Standardisierung/GND/gnd_node.html) (Gemeinsame Normdatei / Integrated Authority File), an international authority file widely used by German-speaking libraries to catalog and link information on people, organizations, topics, and works.


## üìÇ Repositories Included

To support system development, we release three key components:

- [**GND-subjects-taxonomy**](https://github.com/sciknoworg/subject-indexing-dataset/tree/main/GND-subjects-taxonomy):  
  Human-readable formatted version of the GND subjects taxonomy.

- [**technical-records-dataset**](https://github.com/sciknoworg/subject-indexing-dataset/tree/main/technical-records-dataset):  
  Open-access annotated technical records with pre-defined train/dev/test splits. The dataset includes records in German and English, annotated with GND subjects and domain labels. It covers five representative record types: `article`, `book`, `conference`, `report`, and `thesis`.

  Both the GND taxonomy and the open-access records have been reorganized and reformatted with human-readable tags for seamless machine learning use. Since standardized library taxonomies often rely on complex legacy codes ‚è≥, we consulted subject specialists to preprocess and simplify the data. This allows researchers to focus on developing ML models rather than decoding intricate data formats.

- [**evaluation**](https://github.com/sciknoworg/subject-indexing-dataset/tree/main/evaluation):  
  Evaluation scripts providing quantitative metrics‚Äî`precision@k`, `recall@k`, `f1@k`, `recall_precision@k`, and `ndcg@k`‚Äîfor assessing system predictions against the released gold-standard annotations.

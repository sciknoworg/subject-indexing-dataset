## About

This readme provides the instructionss to obtain the GND Sachbegriff (subject heading) authority records. E.g., file named as `authorities-gnd-sachbegriff_dnbmarc_20240213.mrc.xml`. 

### I] Instructions to download the latest GND Sachbegriff file

Since the GND is periodically updated, you can follow the following steps to obtain the latest GND Sachbegriff authority records.

#### 1. Access the GND Data
- Go to the [GND homepage](https://www.dnb.de/EN/Professionell/Standardisierung/GND/gnd_node.html).
- Scroll to the **Metadata services** section and select [**Full copies available through WWW/SFTP servers in MARC 21, MARC21-XML**](https://www.dnb.de/EN/Professionell/Metadatendienste/Datenbezug/Gesamtabzuege/gesamtabzuege_node.html).

#### 2. Find the Complete Sets
- On the new page, locate the **Complete sets** section.
- Click the first link in the table to access the [external repository](https://data.dnb.de/GND/) with GND records for various types of entities, viz. persons, corporate bodies, conferences, geographic locations, subject headings, and works. Each file type is provided in the MARC21 or MARC21-xml formats.

(_note: The MARC format was developed by Henriette Avram at the Library of Congress during the 1960s. Avram's work was instrumental in creating a standardized format for the representation and exchange of bibliographic data in machine-readable form, paving the way for modern library cataloging systems. The MARC (Machine-Readable Cataloging) format is a standard for the representation and communication of bibliographic and related information in machine-readable form. It's used by libraries and related organizations to catalog and exchange information about books, journals, and other materials. The format structures data in records, with each record divided into fields that contain specific pieces of bibliographic information_)

#### 3. Download GND Sachbegriff Records
- Search for two files (MARC21 or MARC21-xml formats) containing `gnd-sachbegriff` in its name.
- Download the file with `.xml` extension. Thats it!

A file can be expected to contain over a million unique sachbegriff (or subject heading) records. A recent download contained 1,860,338 unique subject heading records.

#### GND Sachbegriff Record Interpretation Guide -- How to read a GND Sachbegriff Record?

A GND (Gemeinsame Normdatei) Sachbegriff record is a structured bibliographic record for ensuring consistency in cataloging across German-speaking libraries. Each part of the record holds specific data about the subject term:

###### KEY COMPONENTS

- **Record Type**: `Authority` indicates a record for standardized information about subjects, persons, organizations, etc.

- **Leader**: Fixed-length field with codes for record characteristics.

- **Control Fields**:
  - `001`: Control number.
  - `003`: Control number identifier (e.g., DE-101).
  - `005`: Date/time of the latest record transaction.
  - `008`: Fixed-length data elements like date entered, publication status, and language.

- **Data Fields**: Contain descriptive information, each identified by a tag number and subdivided into subfields (`subfield code`):
  - `024`, `035`: Standard numbers and identifiers, including the GND identifier and URL to the GND database.
  - `040`: Cataloging source, language, and institution code.
  - `042`: Authentication code.
  - `065`, `075`, `079`: Classification codes.
  - `083`: Classification number with additional elements like assignment date.
  - `150`: Main heading of the subject authority record.
  - `550`: Related subject terms, indicating hierarchical relationships.
  - `670`: Sources of information.
  - `913`: System-specific information.

###### HOW TO MINIMALLY READ THE GIVEN SAMPLE GND SACHBEGRIFF RECORD ABOVE?

- `024` field includes the unique GND identifier and a link to the term's GND record.
- `040` field indicates the cataloging agency (DE-101) and that the record's content is in German.
- `150` field contains the subject heading name, e.g., "A 302 D".
- `550` field shows a related term, e.g., "Integrierte Schaltung" (Integrated Circuit), suggesting a relationship between the subjects.

The sample record's subject heading name is "A 302 D." Regarding the meaning of "A 302 D", without additional context provided in the record or without specific knowledge of this classification, it's challenging to ascertain its precise meaning directly from this snippet alone. However, the `<datafield>` with tag `550` provides a broader term or related subject, which is "Integrierte Schaltung" (Integrated Circuit). This suggests that "A 302 D" might be related to a specific aspect, type, or application of integrated circuits within the classification system used by GND, possibly indicating a specific standard, model, or technology category associated with integrated circuits.

Understanding the structure of these records is crucial for those involved in library and information management.


###### READING THREE OTHER EXAMPLE RECORDS


[Example 1](records/record-eg1) Sachbegriff Record Summary

Subject Heading (`<datafield>` with tag `150`, where `<subfield code="a">` specifies the subject heading)
- **Name:** Viehhändlersprache
- **Meaning:** Cattle Traders' Language

Description:
Viehhändlersprache is a sociolect used by cattle traders in Westphalia and the northern Rhineland of Germany. It incorporates elements from **Yiddish** and **Rotwelsch**, making it a unique blend of languages that served as a form of communication among traders.

Related Terms (`<datafield tag="550">`) 
- **Sondersprache:** A special language, indicating Viehhändlersprache is a specific sociolect within this broader category.
- **Yiddish & Rotwelsch:** Both are integral to the development of Viehhändlersprache, with Yiddish being a historical language of the Ashkenazi Jews and Rotwelsch serving as a sociolect for the itinerant and marginalized groups in German-speaking areas.

Context:
The record highlights Viehhändlersprache's role as a cultural and linguistic artifact, reflecting the mixing of linguistic elements in professional and social contexts among cattle traders in specific regions of Germany.


[Example 2](records/record-eg2) Sachbegriff Record Summary

Subject Heading (`<datafield>` with tag `150`, where `<subfield code="a">` specifies the subject heading)
- **Name:** Janus-Pressen-Schrift
- **Meaning:** The term refers to a specific type or style of typeface associated with the Janus Press.

Description:
The Janus-Pressen-Schrift is linked to the activities of Walter Tiemann (1876-1951), a notable figure in the history of type design, and the Gebr. Klingspor foundry based in Offenbach, Main, Germany. It represents a specific design or style created or influenced by Tiemann and produced by the Janus Press and Gebr. Klingspor around 1907.

Related Terms (`<datafield tag="550">`) 
- **Renaissance-Antiqua:** A broader term indicating the general category of typefaces Janus-Pressen-Schrift belongs to, characterized by its humanist and classical proportions inspired by the Renaissance period.
- **Tiemann-Mediaeval:** A related term or possibly another typeface design by Walter Tiemann, suggesting a connection or stylistic similarity to Janus-Pressen-Schrift.

Context:
This record highlights the Janus-Pressen-Schrift as a significant contribution to the art of typography, reflecting the collaboration between Walter Tiemann, a prominent type designer, and the Gebr. Klingspor type foundry. The creation year mentioned is 1907, situating the typeface in the early 20th century, a period of innovation and artistic exploration in type design.

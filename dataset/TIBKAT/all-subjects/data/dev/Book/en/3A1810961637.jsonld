            "abstract": "Recently, \"trans\" has taken on a number of important theoretical and critical meanings inside and outside the academy. As a prefix, \"trans\" can attach itself to other words to express or describe movement and change, as it does in the terms \"transnational\" or \"transmedia.\" Trans is also an adjective when it is part of a word that signifies an identity or expression. Trans has worked as an adjective to destabilize established ideas about gender as it makes new senses of what gender can mean for trans people. Much of the study of life writing is about the study of identity and the possibilities for lives that stories of identity make possible. In that spirit, Trans Narratives: trans, transmedia, transnational represents an opportunity for critical work about life writing by trans people to be featured, as it seeks to interrogate the idea of trans in multiple registers, bringing a prefix to the center of the current field of life-writing studies. It aims to understand through life writing and its theory what trans means when we talk about identities and bodies, and to understand better what the critical terms transmedia and transnational can mean for the field of life writing. The Chapters in this book were originally published as a special issue of a/b: Auto/Biography Studies",

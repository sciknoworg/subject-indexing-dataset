                "R is a popular and growing open source statistical analysis and graphics environment as well as a programming language and platform. If you need to use a variety of statistics, then Using R for Statistics will get you the answers to most of the problems you are likely to encounter. Using R for Statistics is a problem-solution primer for using R to set up your data, pose your problems and get answers using a wide array of statistical tests. The book walks you through R basics and how to use R to accomplish a wide variety statistical operations. You'll be able to navigate the R system, enter and import data, manipulate datasets, calculate summary statistics, create statistical plots and customize their appearance, perform hypothesis tests such as the t-tests and analyses of variance, and build regression models. Examples are built around actual datasets to simulate real-world solutions, and programming basics are explained to assist those who do not have a development background. After reading and using this guide, you'll be comfortable using and applying R to your specific statistical analyses or hypothesis tests. No prior knowledge of R or of programming is assumed, though you should have some experience with statistics",

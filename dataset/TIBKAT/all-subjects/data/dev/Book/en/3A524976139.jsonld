                "Advances in Wireless Communications covers a broad range of topics in the field of wireless communications, with chapters describing state-of-the-art solutions along with basic theoretical studies in information and communications theory. Thus, the book offers a far-reaching panorama of this exciting field. Contributions have been grouped into six areas. Many of the topics cut across all the protocol layers. In fact, as challenging as the more standard communication theory related problems are, it is the multifaceted and multilayer system problems of wireless and mobile communications that offer the most significant opportunities for breakthroughs. Advances in Wireless Communications offers an abundance of stimulating ideas and presents state-of-the-art technologies relevant to wireless communications. This book furthers the understanding of this exciting and fast-growing field, and the material presented is useful to students and researchers in their own search for new and better solutions towards the realization of the wireless information age. The book may also be used as a text for advanced courses on the topic."

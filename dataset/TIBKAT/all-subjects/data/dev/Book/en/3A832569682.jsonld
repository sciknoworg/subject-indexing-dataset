            "abstract": "The power of ASP.NET MVC 5 stems from the underlying ASP.NETand .NET Frameworks upon which it is founded. To make your ASP.NET MVC applications the best they can possibly be, you need to fully understand what these \"back office\" technologies are doing and how they can be tailored to create a high-productivity programming model that promotescleaner code architecture, test-driven development and powerful extensibility. ASP.NET and .NET provide your MVC 5 applications with a richsuite of services including such vital every-day features as extensible request handling, state management and user authentication. Developing a good understanding of the life-cycle of these features and how they impact upon the reliability and performance of your MVC application is the difference between creating an average web application and a best-in-class one. MVC applications that are architected will a thorough knowledge of the underlying platforms will be be faster to write, faster to run and less likely to develop bugs during development. In Pro ASP.NET MVC 5:The Platform, best selling .NET author Adam Freeman explains how to get themost from the entire MVC platform, beginning with a nuts-and-bolts descriptionof the tools you have available to you and working through to the most advancedfeatures. He goes in-depth at every stage to give you the practical knowledgethat you need to apply these concepts to your own code",

            "abstract": "Web-based platforms have become vehicles for enterprises to realize their digital strategy and are key to positive user engagement. The performance of these platforms can make the difference between an effective sale and a negative review. There exist several tools and methodologies to enhance your digital platform\u2019s performance, and Modern Web Performance Optimization has arrived to walk you through them with an expert\u2019s guidance. Author Shailesh Kumar Shivakumar breaks the study of web performance optimization down into four digestible, applicable dimensions: performance patterns, framework and methods, process and tools, and the modern web. This multi-faceted approach ensures a broad optimization of your platforms and avoids the typical pitfalls of neglecting essential steps that so many often do. Shivakumar analyzes web performance ecosystem components such as validation, governance, metrics, key performance indicators, assessments, and monitoring, just to name a few. The book discusses reference architectures and relevant tools and technologies for successfully implementing a best practices\u2013driven solution. Modern web frameworks such as HTML5 and PWA are also covered. Modern Web Performance Optimization puts readers from any level of experience at ease. Accessible templates, real-world case studies, and your very own performance optimization checklist make this book an engaging and interactive learning opportunity for platform owners across industries. Developers, engineers, project managers, and more are set up for long-term success with Modern Web Performance Optimization at their fingertips.",

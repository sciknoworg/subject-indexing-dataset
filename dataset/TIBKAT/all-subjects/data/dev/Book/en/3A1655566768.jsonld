                "This short step by step guide walks you through unit testing, mocking and continuous integration and how to get these key ingredients running in your Swift projects. This book also looks at how to write your Swift apps using test driven development (TDD).Agile practices have made major inroads in iOS development, however it's very unusual to see something as basic as unit testing on a Swift application. Done correctly, Agile development results in a significant increase in development efficiency and a reduction in the number of defects.Apple has released unit testing and code coverage frameworks for Swift development in XCode. Up until now getting unit testing up and running in Swift was not for the faint-hearted. Thankfully now, there is no excuse other than a lack of information on where to get started.iOS developers are faced with their own set of problems such as tightly coupled code, fragmentation, immature testing tools all of which can be solved using existing Agile tools and techniques. After using this book, you'll learn how to make your Swift apps agile and sound.What You Will Learn:How to write unit tests in Swift How to write an application using Test Driven Development Refactoring Mocking frameworks How to set up and configure a Continuous Integration Server How to measure code coverage GUI Testing Who This Book Is For:Swift developers and would be mobile app testers will benefit from the guidance in this book. Godfrey is founder and president of RIIS LLC, a mobile development firm in the Detroit Metro area. He is also author of Agile Android, Bulletproof Android, Android Best Practices, Decompiling Androidand Decompiling Java. Godfrey has spoken at DroidCon, AnDevcon as well as JavaOne, ASP-Connections, VSLive, Codemash, Code PaLOUsa, 1DevDay and many local Java and .Net user groups on a wide range of topics such as Continuous Integration, Executable Requirements and mobile security.",

                "\"This book investigates how citizens who have differences and disagreements ought to relate to one another in a liberal democracy. Specifically, this book advances a metaphor of citizenship that I call 'role-based constitutional fellowship.' Role-based constitutional fellowship, I argue, is a desirable way for citizens to relate to one another in conditions of modern pluralism, where multiple races, ethnicities, religions, and economic statuses exist ('difference') and where citizens adhere to and pursue competing political interests, creeds, and objectives ('disagreement'). Under role-based constitutional fellowship, citizens share a sense that they are united in a common aim and that they are largely committed to doing what is necessary to pursue that aim - that they are fellows. I describe this sense of fellowship as constitutional and role-based:\"--",
                "Introduction: Difference, disagreement, and civic aggression -- Aiming too high, aiming too low : the limits of discourse and ourse and contestation -- Fellowship's forefather : moving beyond Aristotelean fellowship -- Broadening the base : the necessity and dilemmas of liberal nationalism -- Three dimensions of trust -- Principled pragmatists, principled purists, and the liberal democratic front -- Talking, shouting back, and listening better -- Justifying (and constraining) salutary hypocrisy -- Facilitating fellowship : translucent veils, unlikely associations, and constraints on campaigns -- Conclusion: The question of borders and problem of enemies."

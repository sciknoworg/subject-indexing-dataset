                "This book contains 13 chapters in which you can find various examples of the development of methods and/or systems supporting medical diagnostics and therapy, related to biomedical imaging, signal and image processing, biomechanics, biomaterials and artificial organs, modeling of biomedical systems, which, as the current research issues, were presented at the 22nd Polish BBE Conference held at the Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering, Polish Academy of Sciences, in May 2021. Obviously, it is not easy to recommend an interdisciplinary book as it may seem inconsistent in some respects. This is the case here because it concerns the area of biocybernetics and biomedical engineering (BBE), which is not only an interdisciplinary but even multidisciplinary science. On the other hand, the scattered subject matter of the book is its advantage, as the book may be of interest to an advanced and wide range of readers and researchers representing both medical, biological and technical points of view.",

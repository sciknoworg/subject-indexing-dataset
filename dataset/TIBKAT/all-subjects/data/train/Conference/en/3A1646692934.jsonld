                "1 The International Workshop on Recon?gurable Computing (ARC) started in 2005 in Algarve, Portugal. The major motivation was to create an event where on-going research e?orts as well as more elaborated, interesting and hi- quality work on applied recon?gurable computing could be presented and d- cussed. Over the last couple of years recon?gurable computing has become a we- known and established research area producing interesting as well as important results in both general and embedded computing systems. It is also getting more and more interest from industry which is attracted by the (design and development) ?exibility as well as the performance improvements that can be expected from this technology. As recon?gurablecomputing has blurred the gap between software and hardware, some even speak of a radical new programming paradigm opening a new realm of unseen applications and opportunities. The logo of the ARC workshop is the Nonius, a measurement instrument used in the Portuguese period of discoveries that was invented by Pedro Nunes, a Portuguesemathematician. As the logo suggests,the main motto of ARC is to help to navigate the world of recon?gurable computing. Driven by this motto, we hope ARC contributes to solid advances on recon?gurable computing.",

            "abstract": "An increasing amount of evidence showed that gastrointestinal microbiota as part of microbiota-gut-brain axis could influence or be partly associated in the pathomechanism of epilepsy. Idiopathic epilepsy is typically treated lifelong with antiseizure drug(s) with phenobarbital and imepitoin being primary drugs of choice in veterinary medicine. However, not all dogs with epilepsy achieve seizure-freedom. Around two out of three of these dogs with epilepsy continue to have seizures despite treatment with at least two appropriate antiseizure drugs, so called drug-resistant epilepsy. In canine idiopathic epilepsy, it is widely acknowledged that over two-thirds of patients experience behavioral comorbidities, such as fear- and anxiety-like behavior, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and cognitive dysfunction. These comorbidities are even more pronounced in dogs with drug-resistant epilepsy. To date, treatments for canine idiopathic epilepsy and its behavioral comorbidities have not yet yielded a sufficiently effective outcome. The aim of this project was to enhance our understanding of the association between gastrointestinal microbiota, epilepsy and therapeutics, of the 'pharmacomicrobiomics'. This endeavor aims to provide new targets for epilepsy management strategies, with a focus on alternative treatments for the associated behavioral comorbidities. I started this project with a systemic review of the evidence of nutrition in canine idiopathic epilepsy (Part I). Nutrition is a well-known factor affecting gastrointestinal microbiota and is considered an additional factor to enhance epilepsy management. It has been widely recognized for a considerable duration of time that the ketogenic diet yields successful ...",

            "abstract": "The ligands FaslL and TRAIL, two members of the TNF-family, were predominantly described as apoptotic ligands. Purpose of this thesis was to investigate the non-apoptotic propperties of these ligands, like JNK-activation and activation of the transcriptionsfactor NFkB. It could be shown that TRAIL and anti-APO-1 were able to activate the JNK (anti-APO-1 is an agonistic antibody which was used instead of FasL to stimulate Fas). In constrast to the fast activation of the JNK by TNF, the TRAIL and anti-APO-1 induced JNK activation was slow but sustained. The TRAIL-induced JNK activation occured caspase-dependent and independent, depending on the celltype. This shows that TRAIL can engage two pathways leading to JNK activation. This effect is most likely not due to the different expression of TRAIL-receptors as all investigated cell-lines expressed all four TRAIL-receptors. Experiments with TRAIL-R-1 and 2 specific seras showed that only the TRAIL-R2 is activating the JNK, whereas both, TRAIL-R-1 and 2 are able to activate NFkB. In presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX, TRAIL and anti-APO-1 induce apoptosis in HeLa cells. If HeLa cells where treated with CHX and the caspase-inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, TRAIL and anti-APO-1 were also able to induce the activation of the transcriptionfactor NFkB. This shows that the activation of NFkB is not an epiphenomen of apoptosis, as apoptosis is blocked by z-VAD-fmk. But as NFkB-activation could only be observed in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX, one can postulate that the concentration of an intracellular inhibitor is reduced by CHX so that the NFkB activation can take place.",

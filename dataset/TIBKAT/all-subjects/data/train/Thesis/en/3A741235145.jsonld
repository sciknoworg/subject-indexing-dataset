            "abstract": "The aim of this doctoral thesis was to investigate whether the German term \u201cshrinking city\u201d is appropriate to depopulating Polish cities. In order to do so an attempt to define the currently still vague notion of \u201cshrinking city\u201d was made. The urban development of Eastern Germany was thoroughly examined both in a short term perspective and in a wide historical as well as international context, with the Polish urban development used as reference. 25 cities (kreisfreie St\u00e4dte) in Eastern Germany and depopulating Polish cities: \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and the Metropolis Silesia were chosen as case studies. On the basis of the gathered information a \u201cshrinking city\u201d in Eastern Germany was defined as a city with a long-lasting population decrease coupled with over-dimensioned, growth-oriented development policies carried out for decades. Such a development path is triggering negative consequences in the spatial, economic and also demographic dimension, which tend to intensify each other. The thesis postulates that the definition of the \u201cshrinking city in Eastern Germany\u201d is not appropriate to depopulating cities in Poland. Polish cities are characterized by a short-lasting population decrease and this trend is not triggering negative spatial and economic consequences. Oversized growth development policies were never present in the cities and they still suffer from great deficiencies in housing and other basic infrastructure, which derive from the socialist period. Furthermore, radical de-economization, known from Eastern German cities, did not occur in the Polish cities. Both \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and the Metropolis Silesia remain main production centers of the country. This doctoral thesis presents a contradictory view to contemporary publications on \u201cshrinking cities\u201d, in which this phenomenon is regarded as having occurred suddenly after the collapse of the socialism. It proved that \u201cshrinking cities\u201d in Eastern Germany are not the outcome of short-lasting processes, but are deeply rooted in the past. Moreover, they represent a very distinct development pattern that highly differentiates from the one found in Central Eastern Europe and the one in Western Europe. In this way the doctoral thesis provided a new, critical approach to the discourse on \u201cshrinking cities\u201d in Germany. It also draws attention to the importance of the historical analysis in cities\u2019 development research, particularly in cross border studies. In time of European integration peculiarities resulting from centuries of different spatial, economic and social development paths should not be underestimated.",

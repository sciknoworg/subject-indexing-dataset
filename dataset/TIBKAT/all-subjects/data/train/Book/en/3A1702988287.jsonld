            "abstract": "\"Innovation in Coffee Quality presents recent contributions regarding the quality of the raw coffee material, the commercial coffees, and the sensory attributes of the coffee beverages. Modifications to industrial processes are proposed to use defective coffee beans. Traditional methods of sensory evaluation of coffee are compared with new methods. Advanced sensory analysis such as Flash Profile and Temporal Dominance of Sensations have been applied to assess sensory properties of coffee, proving effective in identifying sensory attributes in cold coffee beverage, for example. Other sensory tests, such as SCA, are efficient to evaluate the sensorial quality of coffee brews in the preparation of special coffees and blends of Arabica and Robusta species. From an industrial point of view, computer vision system is a remarkably interesting technique for future applications in coffee sector. Thus, methods employing image analysis obtained from smartphone with application of projection pursuit analysis to determine the quality of raw material, replacing traditional sensory testing are also described. This could also be an alternative method to evaluate the raw material online in coffee processes. A fast method based on the Vis-NIR spectrum and chemometrics for quality control of commercial roasted coffee is presented, in a less wasteful and more ecofriendly direction. Concerning to the health of coffee consumers, the new demands for conscious coffee consumption are discussed, and the beneficial effect of high-quality coffee due to the presence of antioxidant compounds in instant coffee is evaluated. In this way, Innovations in coffee quality brings on innovative methods applied to monitoring the quality of coffee, being fundamental for new researchers and students who seek expressive advances in coffee science\"--",

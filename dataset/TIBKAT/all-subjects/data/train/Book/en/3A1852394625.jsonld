Throughout the book, the global contributors provide an outlook on the possible future of the world if climate issues continue to increase. In this regard, readers will become fully aware of the dangers of climate change and global warming. To counterbalance, the book also provides an outlook on the potential future of the world if changes are made and emissions are reduced. The book begins with an introductory section detailing the major role water plays in climate change. It then moves on to discussion of water in terms of sustainable development and environmental issues, tackling a range of topics including water treatment for a sustainable future, water supply and purification techniques for developing countries, sustainable freshwater management, emerging water pollutant, and agricultural water pollution. The final section of the book focuses on policy issues, with chapters discussing climate change and water justice, and environmental ethics alongside sustainable freshwater resource management. Water and climate change brings together a range of global experts who have specialization in both the developed and developing countries of the world, providing an in-depth analysis of water and its relationship to climate change and crisis.\" -- From back cover",

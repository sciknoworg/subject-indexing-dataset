            "abstract": "\"Venture capital is the economic engine that drives entrepreneurship and innovation through capital investments, board membership, advice, and relevant introductions to employees & customers. Despite the outsized importance of venture capital, the inner workings remain hidden. Venture is still a mentor-led industry and it is an industry where you have to do a lot of self-education--you have to learn by doing, and you have to get up to speed quickly. Until now. Author William Lin spent over a decade in venture capital, starting in an entry-level position, helping to start a leading VC firm from scratch, and eventually becoming Managing Partner. In The VC Field Guide: Fundamentals of Venture Capital, Lin shares his unique framework, the Venture Capital Investment Framework, to help any venture capitalist, entrepreneur, or investor make better startup investment decisions, quicker. Lin delivers an incisive and practical handbook for the world of venture capital. You'll learn about the industry, how to break into it, and discover the art of investing in startups, and more. If you are interested in being close to company creation and innovation while building a career as an investor, entrepreneur, or startup customer, this book is for you. If you are interested in directly impacting economic growth, innovation, and the founders, employees, vendors, and communities that support the broader entrepreneurial ecosystem, this book is for you.\" -- Amazon",

            "abstract": "The book deals with the most striking landscapes and landforms of Nigeria. Attention is paid to the diversity of geomorphic features found in the country, from the coast to the extreme north, approached geographically at the national, regional and local scales, with a view to highlight the combined influence of geological, climatic, biotic and anthropogenic influences, as well as geoheritage potentials. The topics and sites described range from the mainly depositional coastal lagoons and inlets, the most prominent of which is the oil rich Niger Delta, characterized by the mangrove and rain forest, both of which have been seriously modified by human impact; through the coastal lowlands and associated hill country, with derived, deciduous and dry forest vegetation; the very prominent Niger/Benue Trough and associated features; the savanna-semi desert covered high plains of the north and the Chad Basin, each of which features spectacular landscapes and landforms, including human-made forms such as cities and cityscapes. The book provides the readers with the opportunity to explore the variety of Nigerian landscapes and landforms through informative texts illustrated with color maps and photos: it will be relevant to scientists/scholars as well as others interested in the geology, physical geography, geomorphology, landscape, tourism and other geoheritage-related information about the country.",

                "This book presents the results of a novel investigation into building deterioration and defects in Malaysia\u2019s public schools. It sets forth an in-depth theoretical and empirical underpinning the maintenance management of public schools with the view to develop a building deterioration prediction model of building condition based on factors contributing to building defects for school buildings. The approach adopted is mixed method encompassing archived documentation, questionnaire survey and interview of sampled schools in Malaysia. It presents a number of useful tables, graphs and statistical analysis which are useful in understanding the factors contributing to building defects under reference. The prediction model assists the decision making of maintenance management to be more efficient with comprehensive budgeting as well as optimal maintenance and repair work. The book is of relevance to school managers, maintenance management practitioners and academics towards measuring and improving the building condition in schools.",

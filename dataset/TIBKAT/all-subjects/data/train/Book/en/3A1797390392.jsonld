            "title": "Education in late antiquity : challenges, dynamism, and reinterpretation, 300-550 CE",
            "abstract": "\"Education in Late Antiquity explores how the Christian and pagan writers of the Graeco-Roman world between c. 300 and 550 CE rethought the role of intellectual and ethical formation. Analysing explicit and implicit theorization of education, it traces changing attitudes towards the aims and methods of teaching, learning, and formation. Influential scholarship has seen the postclassical education system as an immovable and uniform field. In response, this book argues that writers of the period offered substantive critiques of established formal education and tried to reorient ancient approaches to learning. By bringing together a wide range of discourses and genres, Education in Late Antiquity reveals that educational thought was implicated in the ideas and practices of wider society. Educational ideologies addressed central preoccupations of the time, including morality, religion, the relationship with others and the world, and concepts of gender and the self. The idea that education was a transformative process that gave shape to the entire being of a person, instead of imparting formal knowledge and skills, was key. The debate revolved around attaining happiness, the good life, and fulfilment, thus orienting education toward the development of the notion of humanity within the person. By exploring the discourse on education, this book recovers the changing horizons of Graeco-Roman thought on learning and formation from the fourth to the sixth centuries\"--",

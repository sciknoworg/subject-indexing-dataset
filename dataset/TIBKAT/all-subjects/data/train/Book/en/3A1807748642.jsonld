                "This second edition volume expands on the previous edition with an update on the latest techniques used to study plant systems biology on three specific scales: the molecular level, the tissue level, and the whole plant. Chapters cover topics such as gene regulatory network inference and dynamic modeling using ordinary differential equations or Boolean formalisms; protocols for at-will induction of plant aerial or root organs, or quantification of tissue mechanical properties; mathematical modeling of plant tissue using SimuPlant or VirtualLeaf; and simulating crop root systems using OpenSimRoot or R-SWMS. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols or software tutorials, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Comprehensive and cutting-edge, Plants Systems Biology: Methods and Protocols, Second Edition is a valuable resource for plant biologists looking for different approaches to finding solutions to their questions and generating new ideas, as well as for students who desire to discover the field of plant systems biology. .",

                "This book focuses on the gradual formation of the concept of \u2018light quanta\u2019 or \u2018photons\u2019, as they have usually been called in English since 1926. The great number of synonyms that have been used by physicists to denote this concept indicates that there are many different mental models of what \u2018light quanta\u2019 are: simply finite, \u2018quantized packages of energy\u2019 or \u2018bullets of light\u2019? \u2018Atoms of light\u2019 or \u2018molecules of light\u2019? \u2018Light corpuscles\u2019 or \u2018quantized waves\u2019? Singularities of the field or spatially extended structures able to interfere? \u2018Photons\u2019 in G.N. Lewis\u2019s sense, or as defined by QED, i.e. virtual exchange particles transmitting the electromagnetic force? The term \u2018light quantum\u2019 made its first appearance in Albert Einstein\u2019s 1905 paper on a \u201cheuristic point of view\u201d to cope with the photoelectric effect and other forms of interaction of light and matter, but the mental model associated with it has a rich history both before and after 1905. Some of its semantic layers go as far back as Newton and Kepler, some are only fully expressed several decades later, while others initially increased in importance then diminished and finally vanished. In conjunction with these various terms, several mental models of light quanta were developed-six of them are explored more closely in this book. It discusses two historiographic approaches to the problem of concept formation: (a) the author\u2019s own model of conceptual development as a series of semantic accretions and (b) Mark Turner\u2019s model of \u2018conceptual blending\u2019. Both of these models are shown to be useful and should be explored further. This is the first historiographically sophisticated history of the fully fledged concept and all of its twelve semantic layers. It systematically combines the history of science with the history of terms and a philosophically inspired history of ideas in conjunction with insights from cognitive science"

                "\"Solvent-based paints have been used in automotive applications since the days when automobiles were called \"buggies\" and the horsepower was provided by, well, horses. But recent EPA regulations have restricted solvent-based paints for use only in approved professional paint booths, meaning that do-it-yourselfers can no longer use them--and it won't be long before their use is banned entirely. Paint manufacturers have raced to develop water-based paints as a replacement for the solvent-based paints previously used. These new water-based automotive paints are of very high quality, but they require different methods and techniques for proper application, virtually rendering previous automotive paint books obsolete. Automotive Paint from Prep to Final Coat is the first book to provide instruction in these new paints. In addition to this critical information, author and top professional painter JoAnn Bortles covers all the techniques necessary to get the great results your car deserves. From initial body-panel preparation, to troubleshooting common problems, to application of the final coat, and all steps in between, this book is the only reference you will need to ensure your DIY automotive paint job is done right the first time\"--",
                "\"In Automotive Paint from Prep to Final Coat, automotive paint expert JoAnn Bortles walks the reader through dozens of how-to lessons, tips, and tricks about re-painting a car, whether for competitive show or just garage-time hobby. The book features over 500 how-to photos, as well as sidebars, walkthroughs, and informative text\"--"

                "'A valuable guide to combine so far separate strands of thinking on CSR, DM and HRM. With its global focus, this book cuts through the claims and assumptions of existing understanding and provides data from a large set of countries. It will certainly stimulate insightful thoughts and practices of CSR in HRM'--Sibel Yamak, Galatasaray University, Turkey. 'Bringing together a range of international authors and providing both conceptual and empirical contributions to the study of the intersection of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Human Resource Management (HRM), this book is essential reading for scholars and practitioners in both fields. The chapters demonstrate that although the two areas have not previously been strongly linked in research or practice, there is indeed significant overlap. The chapters show how to build more effective links, giving both practical recommendations and developing new theoretical insights.'--Fiona Lettice, University of East Anglia, UK. This innovative book analyses the intersection between the fields of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Human Resource Management (HRM), with a focus on diversity management. The book presents the scope of institutional engagements with CSR and diversity policies in a range of organisations and organisational networks. The editors explore the macro, meso and micro aspects of CSR, answering questions such as: what are the socio-economic, political, legal and cultural influences shaping CSR and diversity management? What are the institutional practices for linking CSR and HRM, and what are the implications of this for employee and organisational well-being? And, how can the differing needs and expectations of a diverse workforce be fulfilled through CSR? Including both theoretical and empirical chapters, the contributors explore how global organisations and organisational networks can collaborate with stakeholders within their community to leverage their HRM strategies. They share their knowledge of the management process involved in mainstreaming diversity through effective design and implementation of CSR programmes in organisations. This book will be a valuable resource for students at postgraduate and research level. It will also appeal to international audiences, including academic researchers, policy makers and organisational practitioners interested in the concept of corporate social responsibility and its links to human resource management in the context of globalization",

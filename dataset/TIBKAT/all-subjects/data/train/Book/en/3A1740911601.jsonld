                "This book introduces researchers and practitioners to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and its applications in the built environment. It begins with a fundamental introduction to CPS technology and associated concepts.It then presents numerous examples of applications from managing construction projects to smart transportation systems and smart cities. It concludes with a discussion of future directions for CPS deployment in the construction, operation and maintenance of constructed facilities. Featuring internationally recognized experts as contributors, Cyber-Physical Systems in the Built Environment, is an ideal resource for engineers, construction managers, architects, facilities managers, and planners working on a range of building and civil infrastructure projects. -Introduces Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and its application to the built environment for the first time in book form; -Contextualizes CPS with an overview of its fundamentals as well as applications in construction and civil engineering as well as other industries; -Illuminates in the promise of CPS as an emerging technology with examples from many sectors as well as a discussion of future research.",

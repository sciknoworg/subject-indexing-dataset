            "abstract": "\"The ultimate goal of physics is grand - it is to develop a theory that explains all physical phenomena. The name for this is \"a theory of everything.\" While many theories have been proposed, none have fit the bill. In Einstein's Unfinished Dream, Don Lincoln takes us on a journey through earlier attempts, culminating in the standard model of particle physics and Einstein's general theory of relativity. He then explains the obstacles that lay between where we are now and that final goal. In quick fashion, he dispenses with some popular theories that vie for the title of final theory, and then he lays out the actual path being followed by modern scientists. Rather than guessing at the final answer, scientists study data, trying to understand phenomena that aren't yet explained. These are the clues that will lead the field forward. Lincoln introduces dark matter and dark energy, two substances that make up 95% of the matter and energy in the universe. He digs through the historical list of the building blocks of matter, hoping to find a smaller particle still. He points to the imbalance of matter and antimatter, a fact that modern science simply can't explain. In short, the book brings the reader into the world of modern physics research, allowing people to understand what scientists are actually doing to help us answer the grandest question of all, \"Why is there something, rather than nothing?\"\"--",

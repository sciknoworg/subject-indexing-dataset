                "\"Unprecedented upheavals in routes-to-market are challenging businesses of all types. Products are becoming services, online and offline channels are integrating, and new distribution channels are dictating terms to producers. The third edition of Distribution Channels re-positions itself as Sales and Marketing Channels, placing market access at the heart of business and marketing strategy. This global bestseller delivers a rational economic framework to analyze, plan and manage profitable channels to market. It addresses emerging business models and buying behaviours with practical steps, ensuring maximum leverage of channel partners at every stage of the go-to-market process. Sales and Marketing Channels, a fully-revised third edition, takes a multi-sector approach with an entire new series of specialist sections for application to any business. This efficient structure extracts tangible commercial value from partner relationships, integrating innovative case studies like AirBNB, the largest seller of rooms without ownership of any; Transferwise, the peer-to-peer Forex; plus the rise of online retailers like Amazon and ASOS versus the decline of traditional stores like Macy's or BHS. Updates include the impact of cloud technology, advancing consumer channels, monetizing the distribution of intellectual property and the evolving 'gig economy', led by Uber and Deliveroo. Often referred to as the \"Place\" P in the marketing mix, this book and its host of downloadable resources are an essential toolkit for strategizing new and existing routes to market\"--",

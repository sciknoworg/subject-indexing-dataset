The roles of both natural and man-induced processes are assessed, and this understanding is developed into an appreciation of the geological environments potentially hazardous to civil engineering and construction projects.\" \"For each style of difficult ground, available techniques of site investigation and remediation are reviewed and evaluated. Each topic is presented as a double page spread with a careful mix of text and diagrams, with tabulated reference material on parameters such as bearing strength of soils and rocks. This new edition of Foundations of Engineering Geology has been comprehensively updated and covers the entire spectrum of topics of interest for both students and practitioners in the field of civil engineering.\"--BOOK JACKET",

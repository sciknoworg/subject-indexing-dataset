            "abstract": "Observers no longer need to wonder what they will turn their attention to each night of the year with this updated text of a beloved favorite from Sir Partick Moore. His night-by-night account of the stars is the best possible guide an observer could ask for, and now includes the latest data for the years 2015-2020, preserving and extending Sir Patrick Moore's legacy. This new edition of his classic text makes it easy to see why Sir Patrick Moore was such a helpful guide to generations of budding astronomers, professional and amateur alike. For every night of the year Patrick gives the reader details of interesting objects that can be seen from Earth. It is a book for people with a wide interest in practical astronomy, those who may not have specialized in a specific area of astronomy and wish to expand their knowledge in all areas. This third edition includes Sir Patrick\u2019s original text but revises its time-sensitive material and adds all of the points of interest that change from year to year, such as eclipses, occultations, planetary positions, and so on.  Sir Patrick Moore left behind an enormous legacy, including the world's longest-running television series with the same original presenter, the BBC's The Sky at Night, and more than 70 written works. His influence on the world of amateur astronomy was phenomenal, and his knowledge and passion led many to take up observing as a life-long hobby. This book, \u201cThe Observer\u2019s Year, 366 Nights of the Universe\u201d w as, he said, one of his personal favorites. It now features a tribute to Patrick Moore's legacy as well as including what has changed in astronomy since the previous edition ten years ago",

            "abstract": "This reference book describes how bioprocessing and biotechnology could enhance the value extracted from wood-based lignocellulosic fiber by employing both biochemical and thermochemical conversion processes. It documents recent accomplishments and suggests future prospects for research and development of integrated forest biorefineries (IFBR) as the path forward for the pulp, paper and other fiber-processing industries. This is the only book to cover this area of high economic, social, and environmental importance. It is aimed at industrialists and academics from diverse science and engineering backgrounds including chemical and biotechnology companies, governmental and professional bodies, and scholarly societies. The Editor and contributors are internationally recognized scientists and many are leaders in their respective fields. The book starts with an introductory overview of the current state of biorefining and a justification for future developments. The next four chapters deal with social, economic and environmental issues related to regulations, biomass production and supply, process modelling, and life cycle analysis. Subsequent chapters focus on the extraction of biochemicals from biomass and their potential utilization to add value to the IFBR prior to pulping. The book then presents, compares and evaluates two types of forest biorefineries based on kraft and organosolv pulping. Finally, the book assess the potential of waste biomass and streams, such paper mill sludge and black liquor, to serve as feedstock for biofuel production and value-added biomaterials through both the biochemical and thermochemical routes of biomass bioprocessing. The economics of the described IFBR processes and products, and their environmental impact, is a major focus in most of the chapters. Practical examples are presented where relevant and applicable.",

            "abstract": "\"The Food Industry constantly needs to reshape and innovate itself in order to achieve the social, financial and environmental demands of the 21st century. Green Food Processing can respond to these challenges for enhancing shelf life and nutritional quality of food products, at the same time as reducing energy use and unit operations for processing, eliminating wastes and byproducts, reducing water use in harvesting, washing and processing and using naturally derived ingredients. The book advances the ethics and practical objectives of \"Green Food Processing\" by offering a critical mass of research and industrial teams who establish a series of methodological and technological tools in innovative food processing techniques and their role in promoting sustainable food industry. These techniques (such as microwave, ultrasound, pulse electric field, instant controlled pressure drop, supercritical fluid processing, extrusion...) in the frontiers of food processing, food chemistry, and food microbiology, are showed here strategically with tools to make preservation, transformation and extraction greener, presenting them as success stories for research, education and at industrial scale\"--",

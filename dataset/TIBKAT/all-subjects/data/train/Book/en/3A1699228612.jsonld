            "abstract": "\"In the World Library of Educationalists series, international experts themselves compile career-long collections of what they judge to be their finest pieces - extracts from books, key articles, salient research findings, major theoretical and practical contributions - so the world can read them in a single manageable volume. Readers will be able to follow the themes and strands and see how their work contributes to the development of the field. This volume brings together articles, essays, poetry, and artwork from Jerome C. Harste's extensive career across the field of literacy studies. This book addresses his contributions to early literacy, reading comprehension, ways of knowing, inquiry-based education, and creating critical classrooms-among other topics-in his characteristically whimsical tone. Following the chronology of his career, each section of the book reflects an important theme of Harste's work and documents the impact of his contributions on the field. Combining his key articles with historical notes, fun facts, and professional tips, Harste tells stories about encounters with colleagues, and covers everything from seminars he developed and taught, the importance of collaboration, how his thinking and teaching have grown and evolved, ways his scholarship was enhanced through participation in professional organizations, as well as pithy words of advice for fellow scholars. The articles in this collection trace the development of a thought collective which Harste helped create and which continues to shape research and practice in the field of literacy education\"--",

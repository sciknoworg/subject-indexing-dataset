            "abstract": "\u201cAnyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it.\u201d Since Niels Bohr said this many years ago, quantum mechanics has only been getting more shocking. We now realize that it\u2019s not really telling us that \u201cweird\u201d things happen out of sight, on the tiniest level, in the atomic world: rather, everything is quantum. But if quantum mechanics is correct, what seems obvious and right in our everyday world is built on foundations that don\u2019t seem obvious or right at all\u2014or even possible. An exhilarating tour of the contemporary quantum landscape, Beyond Weird is a book about what quantum physics really means\u2014and what it doesn\u2019t. Science writer Philip Ball offers an up-to-date, accessible account of the quest to come to grips with the most fundamental theory of physical reality, and to explain how its counterintuitive principles underpin the world we experience. Over the past decade it has become clear that quantum physics is less a theory about particles and waves, uncertainty and fuzziness, than a theory about information and knowledge\u2014about what can be known, and how we can know it. Discoveries and experiments over the past few decades have called into question the meanings and limits of space and time, cause and effect, and, ultimately, of knowledge itself. The quantum world Ball shows us isn\u2019t a different world. It is our world, and if anything deserves to be called \u201cweird,\u201d it\u2019s us",

            "abstract": "\"With speeds of up to 20-gigabits per second and the ability to support up to one million devices per square kilometer, 5G - the current generation of mobile communications technology - may seem impressive, but 6G is set to take these capabilities even further. Envisioned to deliver a peak data rate of 1 Terabit per second and latency of 100 microseconds or less, 6G must be able to seamlessly and securely deliver data in an ever increasingly saturated network of wireless connections without exceeding the energy requirements of 5G. This book covers every aspect of future communication from key technologies, to design challenges, network requirements and users' experiences to standardization, chip design, and industry applications from 5G to 6G. It presents the requirements and use cases of 6G, RF transceivers roadmap for 2030 and beyond, and modelling of RF devices for 5G/6G applications. In here, a modified Shannon's capacity formula that is critical for future advanced wireless communication such as 6G is discussed for the first time. It also presents the standardization of 6G wireless communication systems with emphasis on Standard Development Organizations (SDOs), regulatory bodies and administrations, ITU, industry forums, and 6G standard timeline. The book presents RF/mm-wave integrated circuit design for future communications to provides readers with an easy-to-understand overview of voltage-controlled oscillators, power amplifiers, low-noise amplifiers, frequency synthesizers, high-frequency dividers, and chip-to-chip communications isolation technology. This book is an excellent reference for readers specializing in electrical & electronic engineering, wireless communication, integrated circuit design, circuits and systems, to learn more about the 5G and even 6G communication standards, and RF/mm-wave IC design. In particularly, professionals working in the foundry, fabless semiconductor company, original equipment manufacturer and integrated device manufacturer will also benefit from this book\"--",

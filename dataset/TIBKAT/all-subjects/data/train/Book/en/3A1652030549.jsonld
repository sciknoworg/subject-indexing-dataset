                "First published in 1997, Principles of Tissue Engineering is the widely recognized definitive resource in the field. The third edition provides a much needed update of the rapid progress that has been achieved in the field, combining the prerequisites for a general understanding of tissue growth and development, the tools and theoretical information needed to design tissues and organs, as well as a presentation by the worlds experts of what is currently known about each specific organ system. This edition includes greatly expanded focus on stem cells, including adult and embryonic stem cells and progenitor populations that may soon lead to new tissue engineering therapies for heart disease, diabetes, and a wide variety of other diseases that afflict humanity. This up-to-date coverage of stem cell biology and other emerging technologies is complemented by a series of new chapters on recent clinical experience in applying tissue engineering. The result is a comprehensive textbook that we believe will be useful to students and experts alike. *Organized into twenty parts that cover the basics of tissue growth and development, approaches to tissue and organ design, and a summary of current knowledge by organ system *Thoroughly revised and updated *Includes new chapters on biomaterial-protein interactions, nanocomposite and three-dimensional scaffolds, skin substitutes, spinal cord, vision enhancement, and heart valves *Expanded coverage of adult and embryonic stem cells of the cardiovascular, hematopoietic, musculoskeletal, nervous, and other organ systems",

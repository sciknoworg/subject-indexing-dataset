Many common mechanisms such as automobiles, space structures, robots, and micromachines have mechanical and structural systems that consist of interconnected rigid and deformable components. The dynamics of these large-scale multibody systems are highly nonlinear, presenting complex problems that in most cases can only be solved with computer-based techniques. The book begins with a review of the basic ideas of kinematics and the dynamics of rigid and deformable bodies before moving on to more advanced topics and computer implementation.  The book's wealth of examples and practical applications will be useful to graduate students, researchers, and practising engineers working on a wide variety of flexible multibody systems\"--",

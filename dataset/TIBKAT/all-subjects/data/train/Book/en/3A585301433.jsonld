            "abstract": "In \"Marketing Today's Academic Library\", Brian Mathews uses his vast experience to speak directly to the academic library practitioner about matching services with user needs. This book proposes new visions and ideas, challenging the traditional way of thinking and providing a framework to target users more precisely. Most library marketing intended for undergraduates promotes the collection, reference and instructional service, and occasional events such as guest speakers or exhibits. The guiding principle of \"Marketing Today's Academic Library\" is that marketing should focus on the lifestyle of the user, showcasing how the library fits within the daily life of the student. Mathews' personal and compelling presentation will assist readers in: challenging and rethinking their marketing strategies; demonstrating their value through applied relevance; and, focusing on the needs of the student and their expectations. Written in a concise and engaging manner that speaks to popular anxiety points about new marketing techniques, this book is filled with tips and strategies that academic librarians can use to communicate with students, surpassing their expectations of their library experience.",

            "abstract": "\"This book shows readers how to rethink and reimagine leadership and charts a course towards a new vision of leadership. It outlines lessons to be learned for leadership not only after the Covid-19 pandemic but in light of other ongoing crises around issues such as climate change and global inequality. The pandemic has shone a harsh spotlight not just on the leaders of organisations, but on the concept of leadership itself and the way we lead. Many of those who were in positions of power before the crisis have been found wanting; too often, our idols have turned out to have feet of clay. But does the problem lie with the leaders themselves? Or do the roots of the problem lie deeper? Do we need to start rethinking and reimagining the kind of leadership we will need in a post-Covid world? Post-Pandemic Leadership brings voices from every sector to demonstrate what changes we can make in order to make leadership fit for purpose in the twenty-first century. Illustrating a need for a radical change in leadership, with leaders focusing much more on human relationships, kindness, fairness, well-being and a general sense of responsibility, this book will be of interest to both established leaders and the next generation of leaders in education and in practice\"--",

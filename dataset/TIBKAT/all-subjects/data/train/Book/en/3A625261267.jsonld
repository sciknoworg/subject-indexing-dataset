The book will review up-to-date research results and utilize numerous design and analysis for the whole system covering from Millimeter wave frontend to digital signal processing in order to address major topics in a high speed wireless system. This book emphasizes the importance and the requirements of high-gain antennas, low power transceiver, adaptive equalizer/modulation, channeling coding and adaptive multi-user detection for gigabit wireless communications. In addition, the book will include the updated research literature and patents in the topics of transceivers, antennas, MIMO, channel capacity, coding, equalizer, Modem and multi-user detection. Finally the application of these antennas will be discussed in light of different forthcoming wireless standards at V-band and E-band\"--"

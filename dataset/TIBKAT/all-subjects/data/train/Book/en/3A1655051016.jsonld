                "This book is meant as a present to honor Professor on the th occasion of his 70 birthday. It collects refereed contributions from sixty-one mathematicians from eleven countries. They cover many different areas of research related to the work of Professor including Navier-Stokes equations, nonlinear elasticity, non-Newtonian fluids, regularity of solutions of parabolic and elliptic problems, operator theory and numerical methods. The realization of this book could not have been made possible without the generous support of Centro de Matem\u00e1tica Aplicada (CMA/IST) and Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Calouste Gulbenkian. Special thanks are due to Dr. Ulrych for the careful preparation of the final version of this book. Last but not least, we wish to express our gratitude to Dr. for her invaluable assistance from the very beginning. This project could not have been successfully concluded without her enthusiasm and loving care for her father. On behalf of the editors AD\u00c9LIA SEQUEIRA v honored by the Order of Merit of the Czech Republic by V\u00e1clav Havel, President of the Czech Republic, on the October 28, 1998, Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at the Charles University in Prague, Presidential Research Professor at the Northern Illinois University and Doctor Honoris Causa at the Technical University of Dresden, has been enriching the Czech and world mathematics with his new ideas in the areas of partial differential equations, nonlinear functional analysis and applications of the both disciplines in continuum mechanics and hydrodynamics for more than forty years.",

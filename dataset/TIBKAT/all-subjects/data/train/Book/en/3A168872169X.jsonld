            "abstract": "\"This book will provide a comprehensive overview of important compounds constituting food and raw materials for food production with the emphasis on their structural features, chemical reactions, organoleptic properties, nutritional and toxicological importance. Since the first edition of The Chemistry of Food, thousands of new scientific papers concerning food chemistry and related disciplines have been published, dealing with existing as well as new food constituents, their origin, reactivity, degradation, reactions with other compounds, organoleptic, biological and other important properties. This new edition will extend and supplement the current knowledge, as well as present new facts discovered from the related legislation, nutrition and food safety, since 2012. The structure of the book, and in particular the main chapters, is rather consistently and systematically based on the chemical structure of substances, and secondly, the subchapters are classified according to properties or uses. *This book is an English language translation of Velisek's Czech-language food chemistry textbook, the 3rd edition of which was published in 2009 by the Czech publisher Ossis. Food chemistry is the study of the chemical composition, processes and interactions of all biological and non-biological components of foods. Food chemistry directly affects all food substances, including items as meat, poultry, fruit, vegetables, beer, and milk, so food chemistry is very broadly applicable across food industries and academic sub-disciplines. Food chemistry is similar to biochemistry in that its main components comprise the biological (carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins), but it also includes areas such as water, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, food additives, flavours, and colours. It also encompasses how products change under certain food processing techniques, and ways of either enhancing those changes or preventing them from happening. The principles of food chemistry are integral to understanding of how food may be handled, processed, or otherwise treated -- as such, knowledge of food chemistry is a basic and essential requirement when working in the food industry\"--",

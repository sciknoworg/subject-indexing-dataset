                "\"The Handbook of Research on Food Processing and Preservation Technologies is a rich 5-volume collection that illustrates various design, development, and applications of novel and innovative strategies for food processing and preservation. The roles and applications of minimal processing techniques (such as ozone treatment, vacuum drying, osmotic dehydration, dense phase carbon dioxide treatment, pulsed electric field, and high-pressure assisted freezing) are discussed, along with a wide range of other applications. The handbook also explores some exciting computer-aided techniques emerging in the food processing sector, such as robotics, radio frequency identification (RFID), three-dimensional food printing, artificial intelligence, etc. Some emphasis has also been given on nondestructive quality evaluation techniques (such as image processing, terahertz spectroscopy imaging technique, near infrared, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy technique, etc.) for food quality and safety evaluation. The significant roles of food properties in the design of specific foods and edible films have been elucidated as well. Volume 3: Computer-Aided Food Processing and Quality Evaluation Techniques of the multi-volume set reports on a number of applications of computer-aided techniques for quality evaluation and to secure food quality. The chapter authors present emerging nonthermal approaches for food processing and preservation including a detailed discussion on color measurement techniques, RFID, 3D-food printing, potential of robotics, artificial intelligence, terahertz spectroscopy imaging technique, instrumentation techniques and transducers, food labeling as marketing and quality assurance tool, detection of pesticides, mathematical simulation of moisture sorption in food products, numerical methods and modeling techniques, concept of phase change materials, and dielectric properties of animal source foods\"--"

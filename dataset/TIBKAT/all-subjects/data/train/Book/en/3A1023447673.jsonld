                "It is over twenty years since the first research article on social entrepreneurship was published. The literature has reached the critical mass necessary for reflection and singling out of exemplar pieces, and the exponential growth in research interest in the field now merits identification of foundational and model papers to aid and guide future advancements. In creating this collection, the editors have successfully brought together the most important and influential social entrepreneurship articles to date. Topics covered include social entrepreneurship opportunities and creation, developing business models and organizational forms, social impact and contextual influences on social entrepreneurship. The research review will be of immense value to students, researchers and scholars interested in the field of social entrepreneurship",

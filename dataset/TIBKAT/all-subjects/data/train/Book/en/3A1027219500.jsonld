            "abstract": "\"The Routledge Research Companion to Landscape Architecture considers landscape architecture's increasingly important cultural, aesthetic and ecological role today. The volume reflects topical concerns in theoretical, historical, philosophical and practice-related research in landscape architecture - research that reflects our relationship with what has traditionally been called 'nature'. It does so at a time when questions about the use of global resources and understanding the links between human and non-human worlds are more crucial than ever. The twenty-five chapters of this edited collection bring together significant positions in current landscape architecture research under five broad themes - History, Sites and Heritage, City and Nature, Ethics and Sustainability, Knowledge and Practice - supplemented with a discussion of landscape architecture education. Prominent contributors from landscape architecture and adjacent fields including Tom Avermaete, Jane Wolff, Gareth Doherty, Matthew Gandy, Christophe Girot, Ottmar Ette and Anne Whiston Spirn, as well as up-and-coming researchers, seek to widen, fuel and frame critical discussion in this growing area. They do so by investigating recurrent motifs as well as slippages and ruptures in the historical development of landscape architecture and by paying particular attention to current concerns. A significant contribution to landscape architecture research, this book will be beneficial not only to students and academics in landscape architecture, but also to scholars in related fields such as history, architecture and social studies\"--",

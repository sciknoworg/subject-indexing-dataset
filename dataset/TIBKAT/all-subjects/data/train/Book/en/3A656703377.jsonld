            "abstract": "\"The third edition of the highly successful Readings in Planning Theory continues its well established role in defining the most current debates within the field of planning theory - identifying its boundaries, presenting the works that constitute its central focus, and addressing the central issues that face planners as theorists and practitioners. While maintaining an emphasis on developing an understanding of the process and substance of planning within real world constraints, readings in the new edition reflect many of the developments and rapidly changing dynamics of today's globalized world. Editorial updates and the addition of some 13 new readings place an emphasis on emergent themes in planning theory, including changing approaches to modernism, urbanism, communicative action, power, inequality, and justice in the city. A major new section is devoted to planning in a globalized world, with readings addressing the impact of theories of globalization and of theories of development on planning theory. Essays continue to address the role of planning in developing the 'good' city and region within the constraints of a capitalist political economy and a democratic political system, while seeking explanations and guides to planning practice based on analyses of the political economies of the U.S., U.K., and other nations. Building on its established success and well earned reputation, the third edition of Readings in Planning Theory is the definitive work in this increasingly important field\"--",

                "This book outlines the background and overall vision for the Internet of Things (IoT) and M2M communications and services, including major standards. Key technologies are described: Everything from physical instrumentation devices to the cloud infrastructures used to collect data, derive information and map it to current processes, as well as system architectures and regulatory requirements. Real world service use case studies provide the hands-on knowledge needed to successfully develop and implement M2M and IoT technologies sustainably and profitably. Finally, the future vision for M2M technologies is described, including prospective changes in relevant standards. Key technologies and standards are explained: The M2M and IoT services space includes technologies from the perspective of several technology sectors, namely IT, Telecom and Urban PlanningWritten by Experts in the technology and business aspects of Machine-to-Machine communication, who have experience of implementing M2M systemsEnd to end view of economies of scale, including a look at problems and solutions in an end- to -end fashion providing both technical and business insights",

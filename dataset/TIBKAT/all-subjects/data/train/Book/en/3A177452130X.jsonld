                "\"Plant Abiotic Stress Physiology highlights the various innovative and emerging techniques and molecular applications that are currently being used in plant abiotic stress physiology. Volume 2 of this 2-volume set focuses on state-of-the-art molecular advances for the mitigation of abiotic stress in plants. With contributions from specialists in the field, the volume discusses how plants have developed diverse physiological and molecular adjustments to safeguard themselves under challenging conditions and how emerging new technologies can utilize these plant adaptations to enhance plant resistance. These include using plant-environment interactions in develop crop species that are resilient to climate change, taking genomics and phenomics approaches for the study of abiotic stress tolerance, employing methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid, harnessing the CRISPR/CAS system to strengthen plant stress resistance, and more. Agriculture today faces countless challenges to meet the rising need for sustainable food supplies and guarantees of high-quality nourishment for a quickly mounting population. To assure sufficient food production, it is necessary to address the challenging environmental circumstances that are causing cellular oxidative stress in plants due to abiotic factors, which play a defining role in shaping yield of crop plants. This volume, along with Plant Abiotic Stress Physiology: Volume 1: Responses and Adaptations, helps to meet these challenges by providing a rich source of information on plant abiotic stress physiology and effective management techniques\"--"

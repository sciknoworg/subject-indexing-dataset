This book presents various concepts in the design and development of a smart city as well as methodologies and solutions involved in designing contemporary infrastructure for building smart cities around the world. The book will focus mainly on six areas of smart city infrastructure that are smart city entities, IoT-based solutions, AI-centric control systems, Smart Systems, Cyber Security Mechanisms, Data Science and Cloud Computing for the deployment of the smart ecosystem. AI-Centric Smart City Ecosystem: Technologies, Design, and Implementation will discuss the role of AI-centric innovative systems and beyond intelligent solutions in the smart city framework. Readers will discover how to apply design principles and technologies for operating intelligent cities and develop an understanding of how to integrate AI-based control systems to make systems smarter. The book will present various concepts in the design and development of the smart cities as well as methodologies and solutions involved in designing modern infrastructure, also you can discover how to develop applications and connect the IoT devices for collecting and mining real-time data and uncover the challenges and techniques for improving the automatic operation in the smart city by using the high-tech solutions. This book is intended to serve the needs of industry, engineers, professionals, researchers, master and doctoral students studying emerging technologies in smart city ecosystems\"--",
